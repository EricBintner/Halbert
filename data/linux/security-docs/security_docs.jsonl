It is\nintended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted\nhosts over an insecure network. X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and\nUNIX\n-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the\nsecure channel.\nssh\nconnects and logs into the specified\ndestination\n, which may be specified as either\n[user@]hostname or a URI of the form\nssh://\n[user@]hostname[:port]. The user must prove\ntheir identity to the remote machine using one of several methods (see\nbelow).\nIf a\ncommand\nis specified, it will be\nexecuted on the remote host instead of a login shell. A complete command\nline may be specified as\ncommand\n, or it may have\nadditional arguments. If supplied, the arguments will be appended to the\ncommand, separated by spaces, before it is sent to the server to be\nexecuted.\nThe options are as follows:\n-4\nForces\nssh\nto use IPv4 addresses only.\n-6\nForces\nssh\nto use IPv6 addresses only.\n-A\nEnables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent such as\nssh-agent(1)\n. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a\nconfiguration file.\nAgent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with\nthe ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the\nagent's\nUNIX\n-domain socket) can access the local\nagent through the forwarded connection. An attacker cannot obtain key\nmaterial from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys\nthat enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into the\nagent. A safer alternative may be to use a jump host (see\n-J\n).\n-a\nDisables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.\n-B\nbind_interface\nBind to the address of\nbind_interface\nbefore\nattempting to connect to the destination host. This is only useful on\nsystems with more than one address.\n-b\nbind_address\nUse\nbind_address\non the local machine as the source\naddress of the connection. Only useful on systems with more than one\naddress.\n-C\nRequests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and\ndata for forwarded X11, TCP and\nUNIX\n-domain\nconnections). The compression algorithm is the same used by\ngzip(1)\n.\nCompression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but\nwill only slow down things on fast networks. The default value can be set\non a host-by-host basis in the configuration files; see the\nCompression\noption in\nssh_config(5)\n.\n-c\ncipher_spec\nSelects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.\ncipher_spec\nis a comma-separated list of ciphers\nlisted in order of preference. See the\nCiphers\nkeyword in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information.\n-D\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\nSpecifies a local “dynamic” application-level port\nforwarding. This works by allocating a socket to listen to\nport\non the local side, optionally bound to the\nspecified\nbind_address\n. Whenever a connection is\nmade to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel,\nand the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to\nfrom the remote machine. Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are\nsupported, and\nssh\nwill act as a SOCKS server.\nOnly root can forward privileged ports. Dynamic port forwardings can also\nbe specified in the configuration file.\nIPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in\nsquare brackets. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. By\ndefault, the local port is bound in accordance with the\nGatewayPorts\nsetting. However, an explicit\nbind_address\nmay be used to bind the connection to\na specific address. The\nbind_address\nof\n“localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for\nlocal use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates\nthat the port should be available from all interfaces.\n-E\nlog_file\nAppend debug logs to\nlog_file\ninstead of standard\nerror.\n-e\nescape_char\nSets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default:\n‘\n~\n’). The escape character is only\nrecognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character followed by a\ndot (‘\n.\n’) closes the connection;\nfollowed by control-Z suspends the connection; and followed by itself\nsends the escape character once. Setting the character to\n“none” disables any escapes and makes the session fully\ntransparent.\n-F\nconfigfile\nSpecifies an alternative per-user configuration file. If a configuration\nfile is given on the command line, the system-wide configuration file\n(\n/etc/ssh/ssh_config\n) will be ignored. The default\nfor the per-user configuration file is\n~/.ssh/config\n. If set to “none”, no\nconfiguration files will be read.\n-f\nRequests\nssh\nto go to background just before\ncommand execution. This is useful if\nssh\nis going\nto ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the\nbackground. This implies\n-n\n. The recommended way\nto start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like\nssh -f host xterm\n.\nIf the\nExitOnForwardFailure\nconfiguration option is set to “yes”, then a client\nstarted with\n-f\nwill wait for all remote port\nforwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the\nbackground. Refer to the description of\nForkAfterAuthentication\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor details.\n-G\nCauses\nssh\nto print its configuration after\nevaluating\nHost\nand\nMatch\nblocks and exit.\n-g\nAllows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports. If used on a\nmultiplexed connection, then this option must be specified on the master\nprocess.\n-I\npkcs11\nSpecify the PKCS#11 shared library\nssh\nshould use\nto communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user\nauthentication.\n-i\nidentity_file\nSelects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key\nauthentication is read. You can also specify a public key file to use the\ncorresponding private key that is loaded in\nssh-agent(1)\nwhen the private key file is not present locally. The\ndefault is\n~/.ssh/id_rsa\n,\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa\n,\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk\n,\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519\nand\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk\n. Identity files may also be\nspecified on a per-host basis in the configuration file. It is possible to\nhave multiple\n-i\noptions (and multiple identities\nspecified in configuration files). If no certificates have been explicitly\nspecified by the\nCertificateFile\ndirective,\nssh\nwill also try to load certificate information\nfrom the filename obtained by appending\n-cert.pub\nto identity filenames.\n-J\ndestination\nConnect to the target host by first making an\nssh\nconnection to the jump host described by\ndestination\nand then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from\nthere. Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.\nIPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square\nbrackets. This is a shortcut to specify a\nProxyJump\nconfiguration directive. Note that\nconfiguration directives supplied on the command-line generally apply to\nthe destination host and not any specified jump hosts. Use\n~/.ssh/config\nto specify configuration for jump\nhosts.\n-K\nEnables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI\ncredentials to the server.\n-k\nDisables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.\n-L\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\n:\nhost\n:\nhostport\n-L\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\n:\nremote_socket\n-L\nlocal_socket\n:\nhost\n:\nhostport\n-L\nlocal_socket\n:\nremote_socket\nSpecifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the\nlocal (client) host are to be forwarded to the given host and port, or\nUnix socket, on the remote side. This works by allocating a socket to\nlisten to either a TCP\nport\non the local side,\noptionally bound to the specified\nbind_address\n, or\nto a Unix socket. Whenever a connection is made to the local port or\nsocket, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a\nconnection is made to either\nhost\nport\nhostport\n, or the Unix socket\nremote_socket\n, from the remote machine.\nPort forwardings can also be specified in the configuration\nfile. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. IPv6 addresses\ncan be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.\nBy default, the local port is bound in accordance with the\nGatewayPorts\nsetting. However, an explicit\nbind_address\nmay be used to bind the connection to\na specific address. The\nbind_address\nof\n“localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for\nlocal use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates\nthat the port should be available from all interfaces.\n-l\nlogin_name\nSpecifies the user to log in as on the remote machine. This also may be\nspecified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.\n-M\nPlaces the\nssh\nclient into “master”\nmode for connection sharing. Multiple\n-M\noptions\nplaces\nssh\ninto “master” mode but\nwith confirmation required using\nssh-askpass(1)\nbefore each operation that changes the multiplexing\nstate (e.g. opening a new session). Refer to the description of\nControlMaster\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor details.\n-m\nmac_spec\nA comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms,\nspecified in order of preference. See the\nMACs\nkeyword in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information.\n-N\nDo not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports.\nRefer to the description of\nSessionType\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor details.\n-n\nRedirects stdin from\n/dev/null\n(actually, prevents\nreading from stdin). This must be used when\nssh\nis\nrun in the background. A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs\non a remote machine. For example,\nssh -n\nshadows.cs.hut.fi emacs &\nwill start an emacs on\nshadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be automatically forwarded\nover an encrypted channel. The\nssh\nprogram will be\nput in the background. (This does not work if\nssh\nneeds to ask for a password or passphrase; see also the\n-f\noption.) Refer to the description of\nStdinNull\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor details.\n-O\nctl_cmd\nControl an active connection multiplexing master process. When the\n-O\noption is specified, the\nctl_cmd\nargument is interpreted and passed to the\nmaster process. Valid commands are: “check” (check that the\nmaster process is running), “forward” (request forwardings\nwithout command execution), “cancel” (cancel forwardings),\n“proxy” (connect to a running multiplexing master in proxy\nmode), “exit” (request the master to exit), and\n“stop” (request the master to stop accepting further\nmultiplexing requests).\n-o\noption\nCan be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.\nThis is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate\ncommand-line flag. For full details of the options listed below, and their\npossible values, see\nssh_config(5)\n.\nAddKeysToAgent\nAddressFamily\nBatchMode\nBindAddress\nBindInterface\nCASignatureAlgorithms\nCanonicalDomains\nCanonicalizeFallbackLocal\nCanonicalizeHostname\nCanonicalizeMaxDots\nCanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs\nCertificateFile\nChannelTimeout\nCheckHostIP\nCiphers\nClearAllForwardings\nCompression\nConnectTimeout\nConnectionAttempts\nControlMaster\nControlPath\nControlPersist\nDynamicForward\nEnableEscapeCommandline\nEnableSSHKeysign\nEscapeChar\nExitOnForwardFailure\nFingerprintHash\nForkAfterAuthentication\nForwardAgent\nForwardX11\nForwardX11Timeout\nForwardX11Trusted\nGSSAPIAuthentication\nGSSAPIDelegateCredentials\nGatewayPorts\nGlobalKnownHostsFile\nHashKnownHosts\nHost\nHostKeyAlgorithms\nHostKeyAlias\nHostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms\nHostbasedAuthentication\nHostname\nIPQoS\nIdentitiesOnly\nIdentityAgent\nIdentityFile\nIgnoreUnknown\nInclude\nKbdInteractiveAuthentication\nKbdInteractiveDevices\nKexAlgorithms\nKnownHostsCommand\nLocalCommand\nLocalForward\nLogLevel\nLogVerbose\nMACs\nNoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost\nNumberOfPasswordPrompts\nObscureKeystrokeTiming\nPKCS11Provider\nPasswordAuthentication\nPermitLocalCommand\nPermitRemoteOpen\nPort\nPreferredAuthentications\nProxyCommand\nProxyJump\nProxyUseFdpass\nPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms\nPubkeyAuthentication\nRekeyLimit\nRemoteCommand\nRemoteForward\nRequestTTY\nRequiredRSASize\nRevokedHostKeys\nSecurityKeyProvider\nSendEnv\nServerAliveCountMax\nServerAliveInterval\nSessionType\nSetEnv\nStdinNull\nStreamLocalBindMask\nStreamLocalBindUnlink\nStrictHostKeyChecking\nSyslogFacility\nTCPKeepAlive\nTag\nTunnel\nTunnelDevice\nUpdateHostKeys\nUser\nUserKnownHostsFile\nVerifyHostKeyDNS\nVisualHostKey\nXAuthLocation\n-P\ntag\nSpecify a tag name that may be used to select configuration in\nssh_config(5)\n. Refer to the\nTag\nand\nMatch\nkeywords in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information.\n-p\nport\nPort to connect to on the remote host. This can be specified on a per-host\nbasis in the configuration file.\n-Q\nquery_option\nQueries for the algorithms supported by one of the following features:\ncipher\n(supported symmetric ciphers),\ncipher-auth\n(supported symmetric ciphers that\nsupport authenticated encryption),\nhelp\n(supported\nquery terms for use with the\n-Q\nflag),\nmac\n(supported message integrity codes),\nkex\n(key exchange algorithms),\nkey\n(key types),\nkey-ca-sign\n(valid CA signature algorithms for certificates),\nkey-cert\n(certificate key types),\nkey-plain\n(non-certificate key types),\nkey-sig\n(all key types and signature algorithms),\nprotocol-version\n(supported SSH protocol versions),\nand\nsig\n(supported signature algorithms).\nAlternatively, any keyword from\nssh_config(5)\nor\nsshd_config(5)\nthat takes an algorithm list may be used as an alias\nfor the corresponding query_option.\n-q\nQuiet mode. Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed.\n-R\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\n:\nhost\n:\nhostport\n-R\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\n:\nlocal_socket\n-R\nremote_socket\n:\nhost\n:\nhostport\n-R\nremote_socket\n:\nlocal_socket\n-R\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\nSpecifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the\nremote (server) host are to be forwarded to the local side.\nThis works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP\nport\nor to a Unix socket on the remote side.\nWhenever a connection is made to this port or Unix socket, the\nconnection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is\nmade from the local machine to either an explicit destination specified\nby\nhost\nport\nhostport\n, or\nlocal_socket\n, or, if no explicit destination was\nspecified,\nssh\nwill act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy and\nforward connections to the destinations requested by the remote SOCKS\nclient.\nPort forwardings can also be specified in the configuration\nfile. Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on\nthe remote machine. IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the\naddress in square brackets.\nBy default, TCP listening sockets on the server will be bound\nto the loopback interface only. This may be overridden by specifying a\nbind_address\n. An empty\nbind_address\n, or the address\n‘\n*\n’, indicates that the remote\nsocket should listen on all interfaces. Specifying a remote\nbind_address\nwill only succeed if the server's\nGatewayPorts\noption is enabled (see\nsshd_config(5)\n).\nIf the\nport\nargument is\n‘\n0\n’, the listen port will be\ndynamically allocated on the server and reported to the client at run\ntime. When used together with\n-O forward\n, the\nallocated port will be printed to the standard output.\n-S\nctl_path\nSpecifies the location of a control socket for connection sharing, or the\nstring “none” to disable connection sharing. Refer to the\ndescription of\nControlPath\nand\nControlMaster\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor details.\n-s\nMay be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system.\nSubsystems facilitate the use of SSH as a secure transport for other\napplications (e.g.\nsftp(1)\n). The subsystem is specified as the remote command. Refer\nto the description of\nSessionType\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor details.\n-T\nDisable pseudo-terminal allocation.\n-t\nForce pseudo-terminal allocation. This can be used to execute arbitrary\nscreen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g.\nwhen implementing menu services. Multiple\n-t\noptions force tty allocation, even if\nssh\nhas no\nlocal tty.\n-V\nDisplay the version number and exit.\n-v\nVerbose mode. Causes\nssh\nto print debugging\nmessages about its progress. This is helpful in debugging connection,\nauthentication, and configuration problems. Multiple\n-v\noptions increase the verbosity. The maximum is\n3.\n-W\nhost\n:\nport\nRequests that standard input and output on the client be forwarded to\nhost\non\nport\nover the secure\nchannel. Implies\n-N\n,\n-T\n,\nExitOnForwardFailure\nand\nClearAllForwardings\n, though these can be\noverridden in the configuration file or using\n-o\ncommand line options.\n-w\nlocal_tun\n[:\nremote_tun\n]\nRequests tunnel device forwarding with the specified\ntun(4)\ndevices\nbetween the client (\nlocal_tun\n) and the server\n(\nremote_tun\n).\nThe devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword\n“any”, which uses the next available tunnel device. If\nremote_tun\nis not specified, it defaults to\n“any”. See also the\nTunnel\nand\nTunnelDevice\ndirectives in\nssh_config(5)\n.\nIf the\nTunnel\ndirective is unset, it\nwill be set to the default tunnel mode, which is\n“point-to-point”. If a different\nTunnel\nforwarding mode it desired, then it\nshould be specified before\n-w\n.\n-X\nEnables X11 forwarding. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in\na configuration file.\nX11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the\nability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X\nauthorization database) can access the local X11 display through the\nforwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities\nsuch as keystroke monitoring.\nFor this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY\nextension restrictions by default. Refer to the\nssh\n-Y\noption and the\nForwardX11Trusted\ndirective in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information.\n-x\nDisables X11 forwarding.\n-Y\nEnables trusted X11 forwarding. Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected\nto the X11 SECURITY extension controls.\n-y\nSend log information using the\nsyslog(3)\nsystem module. By default this information is sent to\nstderr.\nssh\nmay additionally obtain configuration\ndata from a per-user configuration file and a system-wide configuration\nfile. The file format and configuration options are described in\nssh_config(5)\n.\nAUTHENTICATION\nThe OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocol 2.\nThe methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based\nauthentication, host-based authentication, public key authentication,\nkeyboard-interactive authentication, and password authentication.\nAuthentication methods are tried in the order specified above, though\nPreferredAuthentications\ncan be used to change the\ndefault order.\nHost-based authentication works as follows: If the\nmachine the user logs in from is listed in\n/etc/hosts.equiv\nor\n/etc/shosts.equiv\non the remote machine, the user is\nnon-root and the user names are the same on both sides, or if the files\n~/.rhosts\nor\n~/.shosts\nexist\nin the user's home directory on the remote machine and contain a line\ncontaining the name of the client machine and the name of the user on that\nmachine, the user is considered for login. Additionally, the server\nmust\nbe able to\nverify the client's host key (see the description of\n/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\nand\n~/.ssh/known_hosts\n, below) for login to be\npermitted. This authentication method closes security holes due to IP\nspoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoofing. [Note to the administrator:\n/etc/hosts.equiv\n,\n~/.rhosts\n,\nand the rlogin/rsh protocol in general, are inherently insecure and should\nbe disabled if security is desired.]\nPublic key authentication works as follows: The scheme is based on\npublic-key cryptography, using cryptosystems where encryption and decryption\nare done using separate keys, and it is unfeasible to derive the decryption\nkey from the encryption key. The idea is that each user creates a\npublic/private key pair for authentication purposes. The server knows the\npublic key, and only the user knows the private key.\nssh\nimplements public key authentication protocol\nautomatically, using one of the ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA algorithms.\nThe file\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nlists the\npublic keys that are permitted for logging in. When the user logs in, the\nssh\nprogram tells the server which key pair it would\nlike to use for authentication. The client proves that it has access to the\nprivate key and the server checks that the corresponding public key is\nauthorized to accept the account.\nThe server may inform the client of errors that prevented public\nkey authentication from succeeding after authentication completes using a\ndifferent method. These may be viewed by increasing the\nLogLevel\nto\nDEBUG\nor higher\n(e.g. by using the\n-v\nflag).\nThe user creates their key pair by running\nssh-keygen(1)\n. This stores the private key in\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa\n(ECDSA),\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk\n(authenticator-hosted ECDSA),\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n(Ed25519),\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk\n(authenticator-hosted Ed25519),\nor\n~/.ssh/id_rsa\n(RSA) and stores the public key in\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub\n(ECDSA),\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub\n(authenticator-hosted ECDSA),\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n(Ed25519),\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub\n(authenticator-hosted\nEd25519), or\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n(RSA) in the user's\nhome directory. The user should then copy the public key to\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nin their home directory on\nthe remote machine. The\nauthorized_keys\nfile\ncorresponds to the conventional\n~/.rhosts\nfile, and\nhas one key per line, though the lines can be very long. After this, the\nuser can log in without giving the password.\nA variation on public key authentication is available in the form\nof certificate authentication: instead of a set of public/private keys,\nsigned certificates are used. This has the advantage that a single trusted\ncertification authority can be used in place of many public/private keys.\nSee the CERTIFICATES section of\nssh-keygen(1)\nfor more information.\nThe most convenient way to use public key or certificate\nauthentication may be with an authentication agent. See\nssh-agent(1)\nand (optionally) the\nAddKeysToAgent\ndirective in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information.\nKeyboard-interactive authentication works as follows: The server\nsends an arbitrary \"challenge\" text and prompts for a response,\npossibly multiple times. Examples of keyboard-interactive authentication\ninclude\nBSD\nAuthentication (see\nlogin.conf(5)\n) and PAM (some non-\nOpenBSD\nsystems).\nFinally, if other authentication methods fail,\nssh\nprompts the user for a password. The password is\nsent to the remote host for checking; however, since all communications are\nencrypted, the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the\nnetwork.\nssh\nautomatically maintains and checks a\ndatabase containing identification for all hosts it has ever been used with.\nHost keys are stored in\n~/.ssh/known_hosts\nin the\nuser's home directory. Additionally, the file\n/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\nis automatically checked\nfor known hosts. Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file.\nIf a host's identification ever changes,\nssh\nwarns\nabout this and disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing\nor man-in-the-middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent\nthe encryption. The\nStrictHostKeyChecking\noption can\nbe used to control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has\nchanged.\nWhen the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the\nserver either executes the given command in a non-interactive session or, if\nno command has been specified, logs into the machine and gives the user a\nnormal shell as an interactive session. All communication with the remote\ncommand or shell will be automatically encrypted.\nIf an interactive session is requested,\nssh\nby default will only request a pseudo-terminal\n(pty) for interactive sessions when the client has one. The flags\n-T\nand\n-t\ncan be used to\noverride this behaviour.\nIf a pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the user may use the\nescape characters noted below.\nIf no pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the session is\ntransparent and can be used to reliably transfer binary data. On most\nsystems, setting the escape character to “none” will also make\nthe session transparent even if a tty is used.\nThe session terminates when the command or shell on the remote\nmachine exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed.\nESCAPE\nCHARACTERS\nWhen a pseudo-terminal has been requested,\nssh\nsupports a number of functions through the use\nof an escape character.\nA single tilde character can be sent as\n~~\nor by following the tilde by a character other than those described below.\nThe escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as\nspecial. The escape character can be changed in configuration files using\nthe\nEscapeChar\nconfiguration directive or on the\ncommand line by the\n-e\noption.\nThe supported escapes (assuming the default\n‘\n~\n’) are:\n~.\nDisconnect.\n~^Z\nBackground\nssh\n.\n~#\nList forwarded connections.\n~&\nBackground\nssh\nat logout when waiting for\nforwarded connection / X11 sessions to terminate.\n~?\nDisplay a list of escape characters.\n~B\nSend a BREAK to the remote system (only useful if the peer supports\nit).\n~C\nOpen command line. Currently this allows the addition of port forwardings\nusing the\n-L\n,\n-R\nand\n-D\noptions (see above). It also allows the\ncancellation of existing port-forwardings with\n-KL\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\nfor local,\n-KR\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\nfor remote and\n-KD\n[\nbind_address\n:]\nport\nfor dynamic port-forwardings.\n!\ncommand\nallows the user to\nexecute a local command if the\nPermitLocalCommand\noption is enabled in\nssh_config(5)\n. Basic help is available, using the\n-h\noption.\n~I\nShow information about the current SSH connection.\n~R\nRequest rekeying of the connection (only useful if the peer supports\nit).\n~V\nDecrease the verbosity (\nLogLevel\n) when errors are\nbeing written to stderr.\n~v\nIncrease the verbosity (\nLogLevel\n) when errors are\nbeing written to stderr.\nTCP\nFORWARDING\nForwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over a secure channel can\nbe specified either on the command line or in a configuration file. One\npossible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to a mail\nserver; another is going through firewalls.\nIn the example below, we look at encrypting communication for an\nIRC client, even though the IRC server it connects to does not directly\nsupport encrypted communication. This works as follows: the user connects to\nthe remote host using\nssh\n, specifying the ports to\nbe used to forward the connection. After that it is possible to start the\nprogram locally, and\nssh\nwill encrypt and forward\nthe connection to the remote server.\nThe following example tunnels an IRC session from the client to an\nIRC server at “server.example.com”, joining channel\n“#users”, nickname “pinky”, using the standard\nIRC port, 6667:\n$ ssh -f -L 6667:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10\n$ irc -c '#users' pinky IRC/127.0.0.1\nThe\n-f\noption backgrounds\nssh\nand the remote command “sleep 10”\nis specified to allow an amount of time (10 seconds, in the example) to\nstart the program which is going to use the tunnel. If no connections are\nmade within the time specified,\nssh\nwill exit.\nX11\nFORWARDING\nIf the\nForwardX11\nvariable is set to\n“yes” (or see the description of the\n-X\n,\n-x\n, and\n-Y\noptions above) and the user is using X11 (the\nDISPLAY\nenvironment variable is set), the connection\nto the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a\nway that any X11 programs started from the shell (or command) will go\nthrough the encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will\nbe made from the local machine. The user should not manually set\nDISPLAY\n. Forwarding of X11 connections can be\nconfigured on the command line or in configuration files.\nThe\nDISPLAY\nvalue set by\nssh\nwill point to the server machine, but with a\ndisplay number greater than zero. This is normal, and happens because\nssh\ncreates a “proxy” X server on the\nserver machine for forwarding the connections over the encrypted\nchannel.\nssh\nwill also automatically set up\nXauthority data on the server machine. For this purpose, it will generate a\nrandom authorization cookie, store it in Xauthority on the server, and\nverify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by\nthe real cookie when the connection is opened. The real authentication\ncookie is never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the\nplain).\nIf the\nForwardAgent\nvariable is set to\n“yes” (or see the description of the\n-A\nand\n-a\noptions above) and\nthe user is using an authentication agent, the connection to the agent is\nautomatically forwarded to the remote side.\nVERIFYING\nHOST KEYS\nWhen connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of\nthe server's public key is presented to the user (unless the option\nStrictHostKeyChecking\nhas been disabled).\nFingerprints can be determined using\nssh-keygen(1)\n:\n$ ssh-keygen -l -f\n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\nIf the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the key\ncan be accepted or rejected. If only legacy (MD5) fingerprints for the\nserver are available, the\nssh-keygen(1)\n-E\noption may be used to\ndowngrade the fingerprint algorithm to match.\nBecause of the difficulty of comparing host keys just\nby looking at fingerprint strings, there is also support to compare host\nkeys visually, using\nrandom art\n. By\nsetting the\nVisualHostKey\noption to\n“yes”, a small ASCII graphic gets displayed on every login to\na server, no matter if the session itself is interactive or not. By learning\nthe pattern a known server produces, a user can easily find out that the\nhost key has changed when a completely different pattern is displayed.\nBecause these patterns are not unambiguous however, a pattern that looks\nsimilar to the pattern remembered only gives a good probability that the\nhost key is the same, not guaranteed proof.\nTo get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art\nfor all known hosts, the following command line can be used:\n$ ssh-keygen -lv -f\n~/.ssh/known_hosts\nIf the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of\nverification is available: SSH fingerprints verified by DNS. An additional\nresource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile and the connecting\nclient is able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented.\nIn this example, we are connecting a client to a server,\n“host.example.com”. The SSHFP resource records should first be\nadded to the zonefile for host.example.com:\n$ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.\nThe output lines will have to be added to the zonefile. To check\nthat the zone is answering fingerprint queries:\n$ dig -t SSHFP\nhost.example.com\nFinally the client connects:\n$ ssh -o \"VerifyHostKeyDNS ask\" host.example.com\n[...]\nMatching host key fingerprint found in DNS.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\nSee the\nVerifyHostKeyDNS\noption in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information.\nSSH-BASED\nVIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS\nssh\ncontains support for Virtual Private\nNetwork (VPN) tunnelling using the\ntun(4)\nnetwork\npseudo-device, allowing two networks to be joined securely. The\nsshd_config(5)\nconfiguration option\nPermitTunnel\ncontrols whether the server supports\nthis, and at what level (layer 2 or 3 traffic).\nThe following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24\nwith remote network 10.0.99.0/24 using a point-to-point connection from\n10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2, provided that the SSH server running on the gateway to\nthe remote network, at 192.168.1.15, allows it.\nOn the client:\n# ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true\n# ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252\n# route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2\nOn the server:\n# ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252\n# route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1\nClient access may be more finely tuned via the\n/root/.ssh/authorized_keys\nfile (see below) and the\nPermitRootLogin\nserver option. The following entry\nwould permit connections on\ntun(4)\ndevice 1 from user “jane” and on tun\ndevice 2 from user “john”, if\nPermitRootLogin\nis set to\n“forced-commands-only”:\ntunnel=\"1\",command=\"sh /etc/netstart tun1\" ssh-rsa ... jane\ntunnel=\"2\",command=\"sh /etc/netstart tun2\" ssh-rsa ... john\nSince an SSH-based setup entails a fair amount of overhead, it may\nbe more suited to temporary setups, such as for wireless VPNs. More\npermanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as\nipsecctl(8)\nand\nisakmpd(8)\n.\nENVIRONMENT\nssh\nwill normally set the following\nenvironment variables:\nDISPLAY\nThe\nDISPLAY\nvariable indicates the location of the\nX11 server. It is automatically set by\nssh\nto\npoint to a value of the form “hostname:n”, where\n“hostname” indicates the host where the shell runs, and\n‘n’ is an integer ≥ 1.\nssh\nuses this special value to forward X11 connections over the secure\nchannel. The user should normally not set\nDISPLAY\nexplicitly, as that will render the X11 connection insecure (and will\nrequire the user to manually copy any required authorization\ncookies).\nHOME\nSet to the path of the user's home directory.\nLOGNAME\nSynonym for\nUSER\n; set for compatibility with\nsystems that use this variable.\nMAIL\nSet to the path of the user's mailbox.\nPATH\nSet to the default\nPATH\n, as specified when\ncompiling\nssh\n.\nSSH_ASKPASS\nIf\nssh\nneeds a passphrase, it will read the\npassphrase from the current terminal if it was run from a terminal. If\nssh\ndoes not have a terminal associated with it\nbut\nDISPLAY\nand\nSSH_ASKPASS\nare set, it will execute the program\nspecified by\nSSH_ASKPASS\nand open an X11 window to\nread the passphrase. This is particularly useful when calling\nssh\nfrom a\n.xsession\nor\nrelated script. (Note that on some machines it may be necessary to\nredirect the input from\n/dev/null\nto make this\nwork.)\nSSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE\nAllows further control over the use of an askpass program. If this\nvariable is set to “never” then\nssh\nwill never attempt to use one. If it is set to “prefer”,\nthen\nssh\nwill prefer to use the askpass program\ninstead of the TTY when requesting passwords. Finally, if the variable is\nset to “force”, then the askpass program will be used for\nall passphrase input regardless of whether\nDISPLAY\nis set.\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK\nIdentifies the path of a\nUNIX\n-domain socket used\nto communicate with the agent.\nSSH_CONNECTION\nIdentifies the client and server ends of the connection. The variable\ncontains four space-separated values: client IP address, client port\nnumber, server IP address, and server port number.\nSSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\nThis variable contains the original command line if a forced command is\nexecuted. It can be used to extract the original arguments.\nSSH_TTY\nThis is set to the name of the tty (path to the device) associated with\nthe current shell or command. If the current session has no tty, this\nvariable is not set.\nSSH_TUNNEL\nOptionally set by\nsshd(8)\nto contain the interface names assigned if tunnel\nforwarding was requested by the client.\nSSH_USER_AUTH\nOptionally set by\nsshd(8)\n, this variable may contain a pathname to a file that lists\nthe authentication methods successfully used when the session was\nestablished, including any public keys that were used.\nTZ\nThis variable is set to indicate the present time zone if it was set when\nthe daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes the value on to new\nconnections).\nUSER\nSet to the name of the user logging in.\nAdditionally,\nssh\nreads\n~/.ssh/environment\n, and adds lines of the format\n“VARNAME=value” to the environment if the file exists and\nusers are allowed to change their environment. For more information, see the\nPermitUserEnvironment\noption in\nsshd_config(5)\n.\nFILES\n~/.rhosts\nThis file is used for host-based authentication (see above). On some\nmachines this file may need to be world-readable if the user's home\ndirectory is on an NFS partition, because\nsshd(8)\nreads it as root. Additionally, this file must be owned by the user, and\nmust not have write permissions for anyone else. The recommended\npermission for most machines is read/write for the user, and not\naccessible by others.\n~/.shosts\nThis file is used in exactly the same way as\n.rhosts\n, but allows host-based authentication\nwithout permitting login with rlogin/rsh.\n~/.ssh/\nThis directory is the default location for all user-specific configuration\nand authentication information. There is no general requirement to keep\nthe entire contents of this directory secret, but the recommended\npermissions are read/write/execute for the user, and not accessible by\nothers.\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nLists the public keys (ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA) that can be used for logging\nin as this user. The format of this file is described in the\nsshd(8)\nmanual page. This file is not highly sensitive, but the recommended\npermissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.\n~/.ssh/config\nThis is the per-user configuration file. The file format and configuration\noptions are described in\nssh_config(5)\n. Because of the potential for abuse, this file must\nhave strict permissions: read/write for the user, and not writable by\nothers.\n~/.ssh/environment\nContains additional definitions for environment variables; see\nENVIRONMENT\n, above.\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk\n~/.ssh/id_rsa\nContains the private key for authentication. These files contain sensitive\ndata and should be readable by the user but not accessible by others\n(read/write/execute).\nssh\nwill simply ignore a\nprivate key file if it is accessible by others. It is possible to specify\na passphrase when generating the key which will be used to encrypt the\nsensitive part of this file using AES-128.\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub\n~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nContains the public key for authentication. These files are not sensitive\nand can (but need not) be readable by anyone.\n~/.ssh/known_hosts\nContains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged into that\nare not already in the systemwide list of known host keys. See\nsshd(8)\nfor\nfurther details of the format of this file.\n~/.ssh/rc\nCommands in this file are executed by\nssh\nwhen the\nuser logs in, just before the user's shell (or command) is started.

The file contains\nkeyword-argument pairs, one per line. Unless noted otherwise, for each\nkeyword, the first obtained value will be used. Lines starting with\n‘\n#\n’ and empty lines are interpreted as\ncomments. Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (\") in\norder to represent arguments containing spaces.\nThe possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that\nkeywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):\nAcceptEnv\nSpecifies what environment variables sent by the client will be copied\ninto the session's\nenviron(7)\n. See\nSendEnv\nand\nSetEnv\nin\nssh_config(5)\nfor how to configure the client. The\nTERM\nenvironment variable is always accepted\nwhenever the client requests a pseudo-terminal as it is required by the\nprotocol. Variables are specified by name, which may contain the wildcard\ncharacters ‘\n*\n’ and\n‘\n?\n’. Multiple environment variables\nmay be separated by whitespace or spread across multiple\nAcceptEnv\ndirectives. Be warned that some\nenvironment variables could be used to bypass restricted user\nenvironments. For this reason, care should be taken in the use of this\ndirective. The default is not to accept any environment variables.\nAddressFamily\nSpecifies which address family should be used by\nsshd(8)\n.\nValid arguments are\nany\n(the default),\ninet\n(use IPv4 only), or\ninet6\n(use IPv6 only).\nAllowAgentForwarding\nSpecifies whether\nssh-agent(1)\nforwarding is permitted. The default is\nyes\n. Note that disabling agent forwarding does not\nimprove security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can\nalways install their own forwarders.\nAllowGroups\nThis keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated\nby spaces. If specified, login is allowed only for users whose primary\ngroup or supplementary group list matches one of the patterns. Only group\nnames are valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized. By default, login\nis allowed for all groups. The allow/deny groups directives are processed\nin the following order:\nDenyGroups\n,\nAllowGroups\n.\nSee PATTERNS in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information on patterns. This keyword may\nappear multiple times in\nsshd_config\nwith each\ninstance appending to the list.\nAllowStreamLocalForwarding\nSpecifies whether StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is\npermitted. The available options are\nyes\n(the\ndefault) or\nall\nto allow StreamLocal forwarding,\nno\nto prevent all StreamLocal forwarding,\nlocal\nto allow local (from the perspective of\nssh(1)\n)\nforwarding only or\nremote\nto allow remote\nforwarding only. Note that disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not\nimprove security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can\nalways install their own forwarders.\nAllowTcpForwarding\nSpecifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted. The available options are\nyes\n(the default) or\nall\nto allow TCP forwarding,\nno\nto prevent all TCP\nforwarding,\nlocal\nto allow local (from the\nperspective of\nssh(1)\n) forwarding only or\nremote\nto allow\nremote forwarding only. Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not\nimprove security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can\nalways install their own forwarders.\nAllowUsers\nThis keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by\nspaces. If specified, login is allowed only for user names that match one\nof the patterns. Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not\nrecognized. By default, login is allowed for all users. If the pattern\ntakes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately checked,\nrestricting logins to particular users from particular hosts. HOST\ncriteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR\naddress/masklen format. The allow/deny users directives are processed in\nthe following order:\nDenyUsers\n,\nAllowUsers\n.\nSee PATTERNS in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information on patterns. This keyword may\nappear multiple times in\nsshd_config\nwith each\ninstance appending to the list.\nAuthenticationMethods\nSpecifies the authentication methods that must be successfully completed\nfor a user to be granted access. This option must be followed by one or\nmore lists of comma-separated authentication method names, or by the\nsingle string\nany\nto indicate the default\nbehaviour of accepting any single authentication method. If the default is\noverridden, then successful authentication requires completion of every\nmethod in at least one of these lists.\nFor example, \"publickey,password\npublickey,keyboard-interactive\" would require the user to complete\npublic key authentication, followed by either password or keyboard\ninteractive authentication. Only methods that are next in one or more\nlists are offered at each stage, so for this example it would not be\npossible to attempt password or keyboard-interactive authentication\nbefore public key.\nFor keyboard interactive authentication it is also possible to\nrestrict authentication to a specific device by appending a colon\nfollowed by the device identifier\nbsdauth\n,\npam\n, or\nskey\n, depending\non the server configuration. For example,\n\"keyboard-interactive:bsdauth\" would restrict keyboard\ninteractive authentication to the\nbsdauth\ndevice.\nIf the publickey method is listed more than once,\nsshd(8)\nverifies that keys that have been used successfully are not reused for\nsubsequent authentications. For example, \"publickey,publickey\"\nrequires successful authentication using two different public keys.\nNote that each authentication method listed should also be\nexplicitly enabled in the configuration.\nThe available authentication methods are:\n\"gssapi-with-mic\", \"hostbased\",\n\"keyboard-interactive\", \"none\" (used for access to\npassword-less accounts when\nPermitEmptyPasswords\nis enabled), \"password\" and \"publickey\".\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\nSpecifies a program to be used to look up the user's public keys. The\nprogram must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and\nspecified by an absolute path. Arguments to\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\naccept the tokens described\nin the\nTOKENS\nsection. If no arguments\nare specified then the username of the target user is used.\nThe program should produce on standard output zero or more\nlines of authorized_keys output (see\nAUTHORIZED_KEYS\nin\nsshd(8)\n).\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\nis tried after the usual\nAuthorizedKeysFile\nfiles and will not be\nexecuted if a matching key is found there. By default, no\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\nis run.\nAuthorizedKeysCommandUser\nSpecifies the user under whose account the\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\nis run. It is recommended to\nuse a dedicated user that has no other role on the host than running\nauthorized keys commands. If\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\nis specified but\nAuthorizedKeysCommandUser\nis not,\nthen\nsshd(8)\nwill refuse to start.\nAuthorizedKeysFile\nSpecifies the file that contains the public keys used for user\nauthentication. The format is described in the AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT\nsection of\nsshd(8)\n. Arguments to\nAuthorizedKeysFile\nmay include wildcards and accept the tokens described in the\nTOKENS\nsection. After expansion,\nAuthorizedKeysFile\nis taken to be an absolute path\nor one relative to the user's home directory. Multiple files may be\nlisted, separated by whitespace. Alternately this option may be set to\nnone\nto skip checking for user keys in files. The\ndefault is \".ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2\".\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\nSpecifies a program to be used to generate the list of allowed certificate\nprincipals as per\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\n. The\nprogram must be owned by root, not writable by group or others and\nspecified by an absolute path. Arguments to\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\naccept the tokens\ndescribed in the\nTOKENS\nsection. If no\narguments are specified then the username of the target user is used.\nThe program should produce on standard output zero or more\nlines of\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\noutput. If\neither\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\nor\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\nis specified, then\ncertificates offered by the client for authentication must contain a\nprincipal that is listed. By default, no\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\nis run.\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser\nSpecifies the user under whose account the\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\nis run. It is\nrecommended to use a dedicated user that has no other role on the host\nthan running authorized principals commands. If\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\nis specified but\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser\nis not, then\nsshd(8)\nwill\nrefuse to start.\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\nSpecifies a file that lists principal names that are accepted for\ncertificate authentication. When using certificates signed by a key listed\nin\nTrustedUserCAKeys\n, this file lists names, one\nof which must appear in the certificate for it to be accepted for\nauthentication. Names are listed one per line preceded by key options (as\ndescribed in\nAUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT\nin\nsshd(8)\n).\nEmpty lines and comments starting with\n‘\n#\n’ are ignored.\nArguments to\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\nmay include wildcards and accept the tokens described in the\nTOKENS\nsection. After expansion,\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\nis taken to be an\nabsolute path or one relative to the user's home directory. The default\nis\nnone\n, i.e. not to use a principals file\n– in this case, the username of the user must appear in a\ncertificate's principals list for it to be accepted.\nNote that\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\nis\nonly used when authentication proceeds using a CA listed in\nTrustedUserCAKeys\nand is not consulted for\ncertification authorities trusted via\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n, though the\nprincipals=\nkey option offers a similar facility\n(see\nsshd(8)\nfor details).\nBanner\nThe contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user before\nauthentication is allowed. If the argument is\nnone\nthen no banner is displayed. By default, no banner is displayed.\nCASignatureAlgorithms\nSpecifies which algorithms are allowed for signing of certificates by\ncertificate authorities (CAs). The default is:\nssh-ed25519,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,\necdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,\nsk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256\nIf the specified list begins with a ‘+’\ncharacter, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the default\nset instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a\n‘-’ character, then the specified algorithms (including\nwildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing\nthem.\nCertificates signed using other algorithms will not be\naccepted for public key or host-based authentication.\nChannelTimeout\nSpecifies whether and how quickly\nsshd(8)\nshould close inactive channels. Timeouts are specified as one or more\n“type=interval” pairs separated by whitespace, where the\n“type” must be the special keyword “global” or\na channel type name from the list below, optionally containing wildcard\ncharacters.\nThe timeout value “interval” is specified in\nseconds or may use any of the units documented in the\nTIME FORMATS\nsection. For\nexample, “session=5m” would cause interactive sessions to\nterminate after five minutes of inactivity. Specifying a zero value\ndisables the inactivity timeout.\nThe special timeout “global” applies to all\nactive channels, taken together. Traffic on any active channel will\nreset the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open channels\nwill be closed. Note that this global timeout is not matched by\nwildcards and must be specified explicitly.\nThe available channel type names include:\nagent-connection\nOpen connections to\nssh-agent(1)\n.\ndirect-tcpip\n,\ndirect-streamlocal@openssh.com\nOpen TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been\nestablished from an\nssh(1)\nlocal forwarding, i.e.\nLocalForward\nor\nDynamicForward\n.\nforwarded-tcpip\n,\nforwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com\nOpen TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been\nestablished to an\nsshd(8)\nlistening on behalf of an\nssh(1)\nremote forwarding, i.e.\nRemoteForward\n.\nsession\nThe interactive main session, including shell session, command\nexecution,\nscp(1)\n,\nsftp(1)\n, etc.\ntun-connection\nOpen\nTunnelForward\nconnections.\nx11-connection\nOpen X11 forwarding sessions.\nNote that in all the above cases, terminating an inactive\nsession does not guarantee to remove all resources associated with the\nsession, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients relating to the session may\ncontinue to execute.\nMoreover, terminating an inactive channel or session does not\nnecessarily close the SSH connection, nor does it prevent a client from\nrequesting another channel of the same type. In particular, expiring an\ninactive forwarding session does not prevent another identical\nforwarding from being subsequently created.\nThe default is not to expire channels of any type for\ninactivity.\nChrootDirectory\nSpecifies the pathname of a directory to\nchroot(2)\nto after authentication. At session startup\nsshd(8)\nchecks that all components of the pathname are root-owned directories\nwhich are not writable by group or others. After the chroot,\nsshd(8)\nchanges the working directory to the user's home directory. Arguments to\nChrootDirectory\naccept the tokens described in the\nTOKENS\nsection.\nThe\nChrootDirectory\nmust contain the\nnecessary files and directories to support the user's session. For an\ninteractive session this requires at least a shell, typically\nsh(1)\n, and\nbasic\n/dev\nnodes such as\nnull(4)\n,\nzero(4)\n,\nstdin(4)\n,\nstdout(4)\n,\nstderr(4)\n, and\ntty(4)\ndevices. For file transfer sessions using SFTP no\nadditional configuration of the environment is necessary if the\nin-process sftp-server is used, though sessions which use logging may\nrequire\n/dev/log\ninside the chroot directory on\nsome operating systems (see\nsftp-server(8)\nfor details).\nFor safety, it is very important that the directory hierarchy\nbe prevented from modification by other processes on the system\n(especially those outside the jail). Misconfiguration can lead to unsafe\nenvironments which\nsshd(8)\ncannot detect.\nThe default is\nnone\n, indicating not to\nchroot(2)\n.\nCiphers\nSpecifies the ciphers allowed. Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated.\nIf the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the\nspecified ciphers will be appended to the default set instead of replacing\nthem. If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character,\nthen the specified ciphers (including wildcards) will be removed from the\ndefault set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a\n‘^’ character, then the specified ciphers will be placed at\nthe head of the default set.\nThe supported ciphers are:\n3des-cbc\naes128-cbc\naes192-cbc\naes256-cbc\naes128-ctr\naes192-ctr\naes256-ctr\naes128-gcm@openssh.com\naes256-gcm@openssh.com\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\nThe default is:\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,\naes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,\naes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr\nThe list of available ciphers may also be obtained using\n\"ssh -Q cipher\".\nClientAliveCountMax\nSets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without\nsshd(8)\nreceiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached\nwhile client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the\nclient, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of\nclient alive messages is very different from\nTCPKeepAlive\n. The client alive messages are sent\nthrough the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP\nkeepalive option enabled by\nTCPKeepAlive\nis\nspoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or\nserver depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.\nThe default value is 3. If\nClientAliveInterval\nis set to 15, and\nClientAliveCountMax\nis left at the default,\nunresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45\nseconds. Setting a zero\nClientAliveCountMax\ndisables connection termination.\nClientAliveInterval\nSets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been\nreceived from the client,\nsshd(8)\nwill send a message through the encrypted channel\nto request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that\nthese messages will not be sent to the client.\nCompression\nSpecifies whether compression is enabled after the user has authenticated\nsuccessfully. The argument must be\nyes\n,\ndelayed\n(a legacy synonym for\nyes\n) or\nno\n. The default is\nyes\n.\nDenyGroups\nThis keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns, separated\nby spaces. Login is disallowed for users whose primary group or\nsupplementary group list matches one of the patterns. Only group names are\nvalid; a numerical group ID is not recognized. By default, login is\nallowed for all groups. The allow/deny groups directives are processed in\nthe following order:\nDenyGroups\n,\nAllowGroups\n.\nSee PATTERNS in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information on patterns. This keyword may\nappear multiple times in\nsshd_config\nwith each\ninstance appending to the list.\nDenyUsers\nThis keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by\nspaces. Login is disallowed for user names that match one of the patterns.\nOnly user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized. By\ndefault, login is allowed for all users. If the pattern takes the form\nUSER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to\nparticular users from particular hosts. HOST criteria may additionally\ncontain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format. The allow/deny\nusers directives are processed in the following order:\nDenyUsers\n,\nAllowUsers\n.\nSee PATTERNS in\nssh_config(5)\nfor more information on patterns. This keyword may\nappear multiple times in\nsshd_config\nwith each\ninstance appending to the list.\nDisableForwarding\nDisables all forwarding features, including X11,\nssh-agent(1)\n, TCP and StreamLocal. This option overrides all other\nforwarding-related options and may simplify restricted\nconfigurations.\nExposeAuthInfo\nWrites a temporary file containing a list of authentication methods and\npublic credentials (e.g. keys) used to authenticate the user. The location\nof the file is exposed to the user session through the\nSSH_USER_AUTH\nenvironment variable. The default is\nno\n.\nFingerprintHash\nSpecifies the hash algorithm used when logging key fingerprints. Valid\noptions are:\nmd5\nand\nsha256\n. The default is\nsha256\n.\nForceCommand\nForces the execution of the command specified by\nForceCommand\n, ignoring any command supplied by the\nclient and\n~/.ssh/rc\nif present. The command is\ninvoked by using the user's login shell with the -c option. This applies\nto shell, command, or subsystem execution. It is most useful inside a\nMatch\nblock. The command originally supplied by\nthe client is available in the\nSSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\nenvironment variable.\nSpecifying a command of\ninternal-sftp\nwill force\nthe use of an in-process SFTP server that requires no support files when\nused with\nChrootDirectory\n. The default is\nnone\n.\nGatewayPorts\nSpecifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports forwarded\nfor the client. By default,\nsshd(8)\nbinds remote port forwardings to the loopback\naddress. This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded\nports.\nGatewayPorts\ncan be used to specify that\nsshd should allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback\naddresses, thus allowing other hosts to connect. The argument may be\nno\nto force remote port forwardings to be\navailable to the local host only,\nyes\nto force\nremote port forwardings to bind to the wildcard address, or\nclientspecified\nto allow the client to select the\naddress to which the forwarding is bound. The default is\nno\n.\nGSSAPIAuthentication\nSpecifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed. The\ndefault is\nno\n.\nGSSAPICleanupCredentials\nSpecifies whether to automatically destroy the user's credentials cache on\nlogout. The default is\nyes\n.\nGSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck\nDetermines whether to be strict about the identity of the GSSAPI acceptor\na client authenticates against. If set to\nyes\nthen\nthe client must authenticate against the host service on the current\nhostname. If set to\nno\nthen the client may\nauthenticate against any service key stored in the machine's default\nstore. This facility is provided to assist with operation on multi homed\nmachines. The default is\nyes\n.\nHostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms\nSpecifies the signature algorithms that will be accepted for hostbased\nauthentication as a list of comma-separated patterns. Alternately if the\nspecified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the\nspecified signature algorithms will be appended to the default set instead\nof replacing them. If the specified list begins with a ‘-’\ncharacter, then the specified signature algorithms (including wildcards)\nwill be removed from the default set instead of replacing them. If the\nspecified list begins with a ‘^’ character, then the\nspecified signature algorithms will be placed at the head of the default\nset. The default for this option is:\nssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nsk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nssh-ed25519,\necdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,\nsk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256\nThe list of available signature algorithms may also be\nobtained using \"ssh -Q HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms\". This was\nformerly named HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes.\nHostbasedAuthentication\nSpecifies whether rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv authentication together with\nsuccessful public key client host authentication is allowed (host-based\nauthentication). The default is\nno\n.\nHostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly\nSpecifies whether or not the server will attempt to perform a reverse name\nlookup when matching the name in the\n~/.shosts\n,\n~/.rhosts\n, and\n/etc/hosts.equiv\nfiles during\nHostbasedAuthentication\n. A setting of\nyes\nmeans that\nsshd(8)\nuses\nthe name supplied by the client rather than attempting to resolve the name\nfrom the TCP connection itself. The default is\nno\n.\nHostCertificate\nSpecifies a file containing a public host certificate. The certificate's\npublic key must match a private host key already specified by\nHostKey\n. The default behaviour of\nsshd(8)\nis\nnot to load any certificates.\nHostKey\nSpecifies a file containing a private host key used by SSH. The defaults\nare\n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n,\n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\nand\n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\n.\nNote that\nsshd(8)\nwill refuse to use a file if it is\ngroup/world-accessible and that the\nHostKeyAlgorithms\noption restricts which of the\nkeys are actually used by\nsshd(8)\n.\nIt is possible to have multiple host key files. It is also\npossible to specify public host key files instead. In this case\noperations on the private key will be delegated to an\nssh-agent(1)\n.\nHostKeyAgent\nIdentifies the UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with an agent that\nhas access to the private host keys. If the string\n\"SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" is specified, the location of the socket will be\nread from the\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK\nenvironment\nvariable.\nHostKeyAlgorithms\nSpecifies the host key signature algorithms that the server offers. The\ndefault for this option is:\nssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nsk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nssh-ed25519,\necdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,\nsk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256\nThe list of available signature algorithms may also be\nobtained using \"ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms\".\nIgnoreRhosts\nSpecifies whether to ignore per-user\n.rhosts\nand\n.shosts\nfiles during\nHostbasedAuthentication\n. The system-wide\n/etc/hosts.equiv\nand\n/etc/shosts.equiv\nare still used regardless of\nthis setting.\nAccepted values are\nyes\n(the default)\nto ignore all per-user files,\nshosts-only\nto\nallow the use of\n.shosts\nbut to ignore\n.rhosts\nor\nno\nto allow\nboth\n.shosts\nand\nrhosts\n.\nIgnoreUserKnownHosts\nSpecifies whether\nsshd(8)\nshould ignore the user's\n~/.ssh/known_hosts\nduring\nHostbasedAuthentication\nand use only the\nsystem-wide known hosts file\n/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\n. The default is\n“no”.\nInclude\nInclude the specified configuration file(s). Multiple pathnames may be\nspecified and each pathname may contain\nglob(7)\nwildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order. Files\nwithout absolute paths are assumed to be in\n/etc/ssh\n. An\nInclude\ndirective may appear inside a\nMatch\nblock to\nperform conditional inclusion.\nIPQoS\nSpecifies the\nDifferentiated\nServices Field Codepoint\n(DSCP) value for the connection. Accepted\nvalues are\naf11\n,\naf12\n,\naf13\n,\naf21\n,\naf22\n,\naf23\n,\naf31\n,\naf32\n,\naf33\n,\naf41\n,\naf42\n,\naf43\n,\ncs0\n,\ncs1\n,\ncs2\n,\ncs3\n,\ncs4\n,\ncs5\n,\ncs6\n,\ncs7\n,\nef\n,\nle\n, a numeric value,\nor\nnone\nto use the operating system default. This\noption may take one or two arguments, separated by whitespace. If one\nargument is specified, it is used as the packet class unconditionally. If\ntwo values are specified, the first is automatically selected for\ninteractive sessions and the second for non-interactive sessions. The\ndefault is\nef\n(Expedited Forwarding) for\ninteractive sessions and\nnone\n(the operating\nsystem default) for non-interactive sessions.\nKbdInteractiveAuthentication\nSpecifies whether to allow keyboard-interactive authentication. All\nauthentication styles from\nlogin.conf(5)\nare supported. The default is\nyes\n. The argument to this keyword must be\nyes\nor\nno\n.\nChallengeResponseAuthentication\nis a deprecated\nalias for this.\nKerberosAuthentication\nSpecifies whether the password provided by the user for\nPasswordAuthentication\nwill be validated through\nthe Kerberos KDC. To use this option, the server needs a Kerberos servtab\nwhich allows the verification of the KDC's identity. The default is\nno\n.\nKerberosGetAFSToken\nIf AFS is active and the user has a Kerberos 5 TGT, attempt to acquire an\nAFS token before accessing the user's home directory. The default is\nno\n.\nKerberosOrLocalPasswd\nIf password authentication through Kerberos fails then the password will\nbe validated via any additional local mechanism such as\n/etc/passwd\n. The default is\nyes\n.\nKerberosTicketCleanup\nSpecifies whether to automatically destroy the user's ticket cache file on\nlogout. The default is\nyes\n.\nKexAlgorithms\nSpecifies the permitted KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms that the server will\noffer to clients. The ordering of this list is not important, as the\nclient specifies the preference order. Multiple algorithms must be\ncomma-separated.\nIf the specified list begins with a ‘+’\ncharacter, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the default\nset instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a\n‘-’ character, then the specified algorithms (including\nwildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing\nthem. If the specified list begins with a ‘^’ character,\nthen the specified algorithms will be placed at the head of the default\nset.\nThe supported algorithms are:\ncurve25519-sha256\ncurve25519-sha256@libssh.org\ndiffie-hellman-group1-sha1\ndiffie-hellman-group14-sha1\ndiffie-hellman-group14-sha256\ndiffie-hellman-group16-sha512\ndiffie-hellman-group18-sha512\ndiffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1\ndiffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256\necdh-sha2-nistp256\necdh-sha2-nistp384\necdh-sha2-nistp521\nmlkem768x25519-sha256\nsntrup761x25519-sha512\nsntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com\nThe default is:\nmlkem768x25519-sha256,\nsntrup761x25519-sha512,sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com,\ncurve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,\necdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521\nThe list of supported key exchange algorithms may also be\nobtained using \"ssh -Q KexAlgorithms\".\nListenAddress\nSpecifies the local addresses\nsshd(8)\nshould listen on. The following forms may be used:\nListenAddress\nhostname\n|\naddress\n[\nrdomain\ndomain\n]\nListenAddress\nhostname\n:\nport\n[\nrdomain\ndomain\n]\nListenAddress\nIPv4_address\n:\nport\n[\nrdomain\ndomain\n]\nListenAddress\n[\nhostname\n|\naddress\n]:\nport\n[\nrdomain\ndomain\n]\nThe optional\nrdomain\nqualifier\nrequests\nsshd(8)\nlisten in an explicit routing domain. If\nport\nis not specified, sshd will listen on the\naddress and all\nPort\noptions specified. The\ndefault is to listen on all local addresses on the current default\nrouting domain. Multiple\nListenAddress\noptions\nare permitted. For more information on routing domains, see\nrdomain(4)\n.\nLoginGraceTime\nThe server disconnects after this time if the user has not successfully\nlogged in. If the value is 0, there is no time limit. The default is 120\nseconds.\nLogLevel\nGives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from\nsshd(8)\n. The\npossible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1,\nDEBUG2, and DEBUG3. The default is INFO. DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.\nDEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of debugging output. Logging\nwith a DEBUG level violates the privacy of users and is not\nrecommended.\nLogVerbose\nSpecify one or more overrides to\nLogLevel\n. An\noverride consists of one or more pattern lists that matches the source\nfile, function and line number to force detailed logging for. For example,\nan override pattern of:\nkex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*,packet.c:*\nwould enable detailed logging\nfor line 1000 of\nkex.c\n, everything in the\nkex_exchange_identification\n()\nfunction, and all code in the\npacket.c\nfile.\nThis option is intended for debugging and no overrides are enabled by\ndefault.\nMACs\nSpecifies the available MAC (message authentication code) algorithms. The\nMAC algorithm is used for data integrity protection. Multiple algorithms\nmust be comma-separated. If the specified list begins with a\n‘+’ character, then the specified algorithms will be\nappended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified\nlist begins with a ‘-’ character, then the specified\nalgorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set\ninstead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a\n‘^’ character, then the specified algorithms will be placed\nat the head of the default set.\nThe algorithms that contain \"-etm\" calculate the MAC\nafter encryption (encrypt-then-mac). These are considered safer and\ntheir use recommended. The supported MACs are:\nhmac-md5\nhmac-md5-96\nhmac-sha1\nhmac-sha1-96\nhmac-sha2-256\nhmac-sha2-512\numac-64@openssh.com\numac-128@openssh.com\nhmac-md5-etm@openssh.com\nhmac-md5-96-etm@openssh.com\nhmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com\nhmac-sha1-96-etm@openssh.com\nhmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com\nhmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com\numac-64-etm@openssh.com\numac-128-etm@openssh.com\nThe default is:\numac-64-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,\nhmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,\nhmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com,\numac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,\nhmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1\nThe list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained\nusing \"ssh -Q mac\".\nMatch\nIntroduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the\nMatch\nline are satisfied, the keywords on the\nfollowing lines override those set in the global section of the config\nfile, until either another\nMatch\nline or the end\nof the file. If a keyword appears in multiple\nMatch\nblocks that are satisfied, only the first\ninstance of the keyword is applied.\nThe arguments to\nMatch\nare one or more\ncriteria-pattern pairs or one of the single token criteria:\nAll\n, which matches all criteria, or\nInvalid-User\n, which matches when the requested\nuser-name does not match any known account. The available criteria are\nUser\n,\nGroup\n,\nHost\n,\nLocalAddress\n,\nLocalPort\n,\nVersion\n,\nRDomain\n, and\nAddress\n(with\nRDomain\nrepresenting the\nrdomain(4)\non which the connection was received).\nThe match patterns may consist of single entries or\ncomma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators\ndescribed in the\nPATTERNS\nsection of\nssh_config(5)\n.\nThe patterns in an\nAddress\ncriteria\nmay additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen\nformat, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32. Note that the mask length\nprovided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify\na mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in\nthis host portion of the address. For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and\n192.0.2.0/8, respectively.\nThe\nVersion\nkeyword matches against\nthe version string of\nsshd(8)\n, for example “OpenSSH_10.0”.\nOnly a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a\nMatch\nkeyword. Available keywords are\nAcceptEnv\n,\nAllowAgentForwarding\n,\nAllowGroups\n,\nAllowStreamLocalForwarding\n,\nAllowTcpForwarding\n,\nAllowUsers\n,\nAuthenticationMethods\n,\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\n,\nAuthorizedKeysCommandUser\n,\nAuthorizedKeysFile\n,\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\n,\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser\n,\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\n,\nBanner\n,\nCASignatureAlgorithms\n,\nChannelTimeout\n,\nChrootDirectory\n,\nClientAliveCountMax\n,\nClientAliveInterval\n,\nDenyGroups\n,\nDenyUsers\n,\nDisableForwarding\n,\nExposeAuthInfo\n,\nForceCommand\n,\nGatewayPorts\n,\nGSSAPIAuthentication\n,\nHostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms\n,\nHostbasedAuthentication\n,\nHostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly\n,\nIgnoreRhosts\n,\nInclude\n,\nIPQoS\n,\nKbdInteractiveAuthentication\n,\nKerberosAuthentication\n,\nLogLevel\n,\nMaxAuthTries\n,\nMaxSessions\n,\nPasswordAuthentication\n,\nPermitEmptyPasswords\n,\nPermitListen\n,\nPermitOpen\n,\nPermitRootLogin\n,\nPermitTTY\n,\nPermitTunnel\n,\nPermitUserRC\n,\nPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms\n,\nPubkeyAuthentication\n,\nPubkeyAuthOptions\n,\nRefuseConnection\n,\nRekeyLimit\n,\nRevokedKeys\n,\nRDomain\n,\nSetEnv\n,\nStreamLocalBindMask\n,\nStreamLocalBindUnlink\n,\nTrustedUserCAKeys\n,\nUnusedConnectionTimeout\n,\nX11DisplayOffset\n,\nX11Forwarding\nand\nX11UseLocalhost\n.\nMaxAuthTries\nSpecifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per\nconnection. Once the number of failures reaches half this value,\nadditional failures are logged. The default is 6.\nMaxSessions\nSpecifies the maximum number of open shell, login or subsystem (e.g. sftp)\nsessions permitted per network connection. Multiple sessions may be\nestablished by clients that support connection multiplexing. Setting\nMaxSessions\nto 1 will effectively disable session\nmultiplexing, whereas setting it to 0 will prevent all shell, login and\nsubsystem sessions while still permitting forwarding. The default is\n10.\nMaxStartups\nSpecifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to\nthe SSH daemon. Additional connections will be dropped until\nauthentication succeeds or the\nLoginGraceTime\nexpires for a connection.\nAlternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying\nthe three colon separated values start:rate:full (e.g.\n\"10:30:60\"). The default is 10:30:100.\nsshd(8)\nwill refuse connection attempts with a probability of rate/100 (30%) if\nthere are currently start (10) unauthenticated connections. The\nprobability increases linearly and all connection attempts are refused\nif the number of unauthenticated connections reaches full (60).\nModuliFile\nSpecifies the\nmoduli(5)\nfile that contains the Diffie-Hellman groups used for the\n“diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1” and\n“diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256” key exchange methods.\nThe default is\n/etc/moduli\n.\nPasswordAuthentication\nSpecifies whether password authentication is allowed. The default is\nyes\n.\nPermitEmptyPasswords\nWhen password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the server\nallows login to accounts with empty password strings. The default is\nno\n.\nPermitListen\nSpecifies the addresses/ports on which a remote TCP port forwarding may\nlisten. The listen specification must be one of the following forms:\nPermitListen\nport\nPermitListen\nhost\n:\nport\nMultiple permissions may be specified by separating them with\nwhitespace. An argument of\nany\ncan be used to\nremove all restrictions and permit any listen requests. An argument of\nnone\ncan be used to prohibit all listen\nrequests. The host name may contain wildcards as described in the\nPATTERNS section in\nssh_config(5)\n. The wildcard ‘*’ can also be used in\nplace of a port number to allow all ports. By default all port\nforwarding listen requests are permitted. Note that the\nGatewayPorts\noption may further restrict which\naddresses may be listened on. Note also that\nssh(1)\nwill\nrequest a listen host of “localhost” if no listen host was\nspecifically requested, and this name is treated differently to explicit\nlocalhost addresses of “127.0.0.1” and\n“::1”.\nPermitOpen\nSpecifies the destinations to which TCP port forwarding is permitted. The\nforwarding specification must be one of the following forms:\nPermitOpen\nhost\n:\nport\nPermitOpen\nIPv4_addr\n:\nport\nPermitOpen\n[IPv6_addr]\n:\nport\nMultiple forwards may be specified by separating them with\nwhitespace. An argument of\nany\ncan be used to\nremove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests. An argument\nof\nnone\ncan be used to prohibit all forwarding\nrequests. The wildcard ‘*’ can be used for host or port to\nallow all hosts or ports respectively. Otherwise, no pattern matching or\naddress lookups are performed on supplied names. By default all port\nforwarding requests are permitted.\nPermitRootLogin\nSpecifies whether root can log in using\nssh(1)\n. The\nargument must be\nyes\n,\nprohibit-password\n,\nforced-commands-only\n, or\nno\n. The default is\nprohibit-password\n.\nIf this option is set to\nprohibit-password\n(or its deprecated alias,\nwithout-password\n), password and\nkeyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for root.\nIf this option is set to\nforced-commands-only\n, root login with public key\nauthentication will be allowed, but only if the\ncommand\noption has been specified (which may be\nuseful for taking remote backups even if root login is normally not\nallowed). All other authentication methods are disabled for root.\nIf this option is set to\nno\n, root is\nnot allowed to log in.\nPermitTTY\nSpecifies whether\npty(4)\nallocation is permitted. The default is\nyes\n.\nPermitTunnel\nSpecifies whether\ntun(4)\ndevice forwarding is allowed. The argument must be\nyes\n,\npoint-to-point\n(layer\n3),\nethernet\n(layer 2), or\nno\n. Specifying\nyes\npermits\nboth\npoint-to-point\nand\nethernet\n. The default is\nno\n.\nIndependent of this setting, the permissions of the selected\ntun(4)\ndevice must allow access to the user.\nPermitUserEnvironment\nSpecifies whether\n~/.ssh/environment\nand\nenvironment=\noptions in\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nare processed by\nsshd(8)\n.\nValid options are\nyes\n,\nno\nor a pattern-list specifying which environment variable names to accept\n(for example \"LANG,LC_*\"). The default is\nno\n. Enabling environment processing may enable\nusers to bypass access restrictions in some configurations using\nmechanisms such as\nLD_PRELOAD\n.\nPermitUserRC\nSpecifies whether any\n~/.ssh/rc\nfile is executed.\nThe default is\nyes\n.\nPerSourceMaxStartups\nSpecifies the number of unauthenticated connections allowed from a given\nsource address, or “none” if there is no limit. This limit\nis applied in addition to\nMaxStartups\n, whichever\nis lower. The default is\nnone\n.\nPerSourceNetBlockSize\nSpecifies the number of bits of source address that are grouped together\nfor the purposes of applying PerSourceMaxStartups limits. Values for IPv4\nand optionally IPv6 may be specified, separated by a colon. The default is\n32:128\n, which means each address is considered\nindividually.\nPerSourcePenalties\nControls penalties for various conditions that may represent attacks on\nsshd(8)\n. If\na penalty is enforced against a client then its source address and any\nothers in the same network, as defined by\nPerSourceNetBlockSize\n, will be refused connection\nfor a period.\nA penalty doesn't affect concurrent connections in progress,\nbut multiple penalties from the same source from concurrent connections\nwill accumulate up to a maximum. Conversely, penalties are not applied\nuntil a minimum threshold time has been accumulated.\nPenalties are enabled by default with the default settings\nlisted below but may disabled using the\nno\nkeyword. The defaults may be overridden by specifying one or more of the\nkeywords below, separated by whitespace. All keywords accept arguments,\ne.g. \"crash:2m\".\ncrash:duration\nSpecifies how long to refuse clients that cause a crash of\nsshd(8)\n(default: 90s).\nauthfail:duration\nSpecifies how long to refuse clients that disconnect after making one\nor more unsuccessful authentication attempts (default: 5s).\nrefuseconnection:duration\nSpecifies how long to refuse clients that were administratively\nprohibited connection via the\nRefuseConnection\noption (default: 10s).\nnoauth:duration\nSpecifies how long to refuse clients that disconnect without\nattempting authentication (default: 1s). This timeout should be used\ncautiously otherwise it may penalise legitimate scanning tools such as\nssh-keyscan(1)\n.\ngrace-exceeded:duration\nSpecifies how long to refuse clients that fail to authenticate after\nLoginGraceTime\n(default: 10s).\nmax:duration\nSpecifies the maximum time a particular source address range will be\nrefused access for (default: 10m). Repeated penalties will accumulate\nup to this maximum.\nmin:duration\nSpecifies the minimum penalty that must accrue before enforcement\nbegins (default: 15s).\nmax-sources4:number\n,\nmax-sources6:number\nSpecifies the maximum number of client IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges to\ntrack for penalties (default: 65536 for both).\noverflow:mode\nControls how the server behaves when\nmax-sources4\nor\nmax-sources6\nis exceeded. There are two\noperating modes:\ndeny-all\n, which denies all\nincoming connections other than those exempted via\nPerSourcePenaltyExemptList\nuntil a penalty\nexpires, and\npermissive\n, which allows new\nconnections by removing existing penalties early (default:\npermissive). Note that client penalties below the\nmin\nthreshold count against the total number\nof tracked penalties. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are tracked separately,\nso an overflow in one will not affect the other.\noverflow6:mode\nAllows specifying a different overflow mode for IPv6 addresses. The\ndefault it to use the same overflow mode as was specified for\nIPv4.\nPerSourcePenaltyExemptList\nSpecifies a comma-separated list of addresses to exempt from penalties.\nThis list may contain wildcards and CIDR address/masklen ranges. Note that\nthe mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an\nerror to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one\nwith bits set in this host portion of the address. For example,\n192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively. The default is not to exempt\nany addresses.\nPidFile\nSpecifies the file that contains the process ID of the SSH daemon, or\nnone\nto not write one. The default is\n/var/run/sshd.pid\n.\nPort\nSpecifies the port number that\nsshd(8)\nlistens on. The default is 22. Multiple options of this type are\npermitted. See also\nListenAddress\n.\nPrintLastLog\nSpecifies whether\nsshd(8)\nshould print the date and time of the last user login when\na user logs in interactively. The default is\nyes\n.\nPrintMotd\nSpecifies whether\nsshd(8)\nshould print\n/etc/motd\nwhen a user\nlogs in interactively. (On some systems it is also printed by the shell,\n/etc/profile\n, or equivalent.) The default is\nyes\n.\nPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms\nSpecifies the signature algorithms that will be accepted for public key\nauthentication as a list of comma-separated patterns. Alternately if the\nspecified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the\nspecified algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of\nreplacing them. If the specified list begins with a ‘-’\ncharacter, then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be\nremoved from the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified\nlist begins with a ‘^’ character, then the specified\nalgorithms will be placed at the head of the default set. The default for\nthis option is:\nssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,\necdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nsk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,\nssh-ed25519,\necdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,\nsk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,\nsk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com,\nrsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256\nThe list of available signature algorithms may also be\nobtained using \"ssh -Q PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms\".\nPubkeyAuthOptions\nSets one or more public key authentication options. The supported keywords\nare:\nnone\n(the default; indicating no additional\noptions are enabled),\ntouch-required\nand\nverify-required\n.\nThe\ntouch-required\noption causes\npublic key authentication using a FIDO authenticator algorithm (i.e.\necdsa-sk\nor\ned25519-sk\n)\nto always require the signature to attest that a physically present user\nexplicitly confirmed the authentication (usually by touching the\nauthenticator). By default,\nsshd(8)\nrequires user presence unless overridden with an authorized_keys option.\nThe\ntouch-required\nflag disables this\noverride.\nThe\nverify-required\noption requires a\nFIDO key signature attest that the user was verified, e.g. via a\nPIN.\nNeither the\ntouch-required\nor\nverify-required\noptions have any effect for\nother, non-FIDO, public key types.\nPubkeyAuthentication\nSpecifies whether public key authentication is allowed. The default is\nyes\n.\nRefuseConnection\nIndicates that\nsshd(8)\nshould unconditionally terminate the connection.\nAdditionally, a\nrefuseconnection\npenalty may be\nrecorded against the source of the connection if\nPerSourcePenalties\nare enabled. This option is\nonly really useful in a\nMatch\nblock.\nRekeyLimit\nSpecifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted or received\nbefore the session key is renegotiated, optionally followed by a maximum\namount of time that may pass before the session key is renegotiated. The\nfirst argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of\n‘K’, ‘M’, or ‘G’ to indicate\nKilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively. The default is between\n‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending on the cipher. The\noptional second value is specified in seconds and may use any of the units\ndocumented in the\nTIME FORMATS\nsection. The default value for\nRekeyLimit\nis\ndefault none\n, which means that rekeying is\nperformed after the cipher's default amount of data has been sent or\nreceived and no time based rekeying is done.\nRequiredRSASize\nSpecifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that\nsshd(8)\nwill\naccept. User and host-based authentication keys smaller than this limit\nwill be refused. The default is\n1024\nbits. Note\nthat this limit may only be raised from the default.\nRevokedKeys\nSpecifies revoked public keys file, or\nnone\nto not\nuse one. Keys listed in this file will be refused for public key\nauthentication. Note that if this file is not readable, then public key\nauthentication will be refused for all users. Keys may be specified as a\ntext file, listing one public key per line, or as an OpenSSH Key\nRevocation List (KRL) as generated by\nssh-keygen(1)\n. For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVOCATION\nLISTS section in\nssh-keygen(1)\n.\nRDomain\nSpecifies an explicit routing domain that is applied after authentication\nhas completed. The user session, as well as any forwarded or listening IP\nsockets, will be bound to this\nrdomain(4)\n. If the routing domain is set to\n%D\n, then the domain in which the incoming\nconnection was received will be applied.\nSecurityKeyProvider\nSpecifies a path to a library that will be used when loading FIDO\nauthenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the built-in\nUSB HID support.\nSetEnv\nSpecifies one or more environment variables to set in child sessions\nstarted by\nsshd(8)\nas “NAME=VALUE”. The environment value may be\nquoted (e.g. if it contains whitespace characters). Environment variables\nset by\nSetEnv\noverride the default environment and\nany variables specified by the user via\nAcceptEnv\nor\nPermitUserEnvironment\n.\nSshdAuthPath\nOverrides the default path to the\nsshd-auth\nbinary\nthat is invoked to complete user authentication. The default is\n/usr/libexec/sshd-auth\n. This option is intended\nfor use by tests.\nSshdSessionPath\nOverrides the default path to the\nsshd-session\nbinary that is invoked to handle each connection. The default is\n/usr/libexec/sshd-session\n. This option is intended\nfor use by tests.\nStreamLocalBindMask\nSets the octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creating a\nUnix-domain socket file for local or remote port forwarding. This option\nis only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.\nThe default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket\nfile that is readable and writable only by the owner. Note that not all\noperating systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain socket files.\nStreamLocalBindUnlink\nSpecifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local\nor remote port forwarding before creating a new one. If the socket file\nalready exists and\nStreamLocalBindUnlink\nis not\nenabled,\nsshd\nwill be unable to forward the port\nto the Unix-domain socket file. This option is only used for port\nforwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.\nThe argument must be\nyes\nor\nno\n. The default is\nno\n.\nStrictModes\nSpecifies whether\nsshd(8)\nshould check file modes and ownership of the user's files\nand home directory before accepting login. This is normally desirable\nbecause novices sometimes accidentally leave their directory or files\nworld-writable. The default is\nyes\n. Note that this\ndoes not apply to\nChrootDirectory\n, whose\npermissions and ownership are checked unconditionally.\nSubsystem\nConfigures an external subsystem (e.g. file transfer daemon). Arguments\nshould be a subsystem name and a command (with optional arguments) to\nexecute upon subsystem request.\nThe command\nsftp-server\nimplements the\nSFTP file transfer subsystem.\nAlternately the name\ninternal-sftp\nimplements an in-process SFTP server. This may simplify configurations\nusing\nChrootDirectory\nto force a different\nfilesystem root on clients. It accepts the same command line arguments\nas\nsftp-server\nand even though it is in-process,\nsettings such as\nLogLevel\nor\nSyslogFacility\ndo not apply to it and must be\nset explicitly via command line arguments.\nBy default no subsystems are defined.\nSyslogFacility\nGives the facility code that is used when logging messages from\nsshd(8)\n. The\npossible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3,\nLOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7. The default is AUTH.\nTCPKeepAlive\nSpecifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the\nother side. If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one of\nthe machines will be properly noticed. However, this means that\nconnections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people\nfind it annoying. On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent,\nsessions may hang indefinitely on the server, leaving \"ghost\"\nusers and consuming server resources.\nThe default is\nyes\n(to send TCP\nkeepalive messages), and the server will notice if the network goes down\nor the client host crashes. This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.\nTo disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to\nno\n.\nTrustedUserCAKeys\nSpecifies a file containing public keys of certificate authorities that\nare trusted to sign user certificates for authentication, or\nnone\nto not use one. Keys are listed one per line;\nempty lines and comments starting with\n‘\n#\n’ are allowed. If a certificate is\npresented for authentication and has its signing CA key listed in this\nfile, then it may be used for authentication for any user listed in the\ncertificate's principals list. Note that certificates that lack a list of\nprincipals will not be permitted for authentication using\nTrustedUserCAKeys\n. For more details on\ncertificates, see the CERTIFICATES section in\nssh-keygen(1)\n.\nUnusedConnectionTimeout\nSpecifies whether and how quickly\nsshd(8)\nshould close client connections with no open channels. Open channels\ninclude active shell, command execution or subsystem sessions, connected\nnetwork, socket, agent or X11 forwardings. Forwarding listeners, such as\nthose from the\nssh(1)\n-R\nflag, are not considered as open\nchannels and do not prevent the timeout. The timeout value is specified in\nseconds or may use any of the units documented in the\nTIME FORMATS\nsection.\nNote that this timeout starts when the client connection\ncompletes user authentication but before the client has an opportunity\nto open any channels. Caution should be used when using short timeout\nvalues, as they may not provide sufficient time for the client to\nrequest and open its channels before terminating the connection.\nThe default\nnone\nis to never expire\nconnections for having no open channels. This option may be useful in\nconjunction with\nChannelTimeout\n.\nUseDNS\nSpecifies whether\nsshd(8)\nshould look up the remote host name, and to check that the\nresolved host name for the remote IP address maps back to the very same IP\naddress.\nIf this option is set to\nno\n(the\ndefault) then only addresses and not host names may be used in\n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nfrom\nand\nsshd_config\nMatch\nHost\ndirectives.\nVersionAddendum\nOptionally specifies additional text to append to the SSH protocol banner\nsent by the server upon connection. The default is\nnone\n.\nX11DisplayOffset\nSpecifies the first display number available for\nsshd(8)\n's\nX11 forwarding. This prevents sshd from interfering with real X11 servers.\nThe default is 10.\nX11Forwarding\nSpecifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted. The argument must be\nyes\nor\nno\n. The default is\nno\n.\nWhen X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional\nexposure to the server and to client displays if the\nsshd(8)\nproxy display is configured to listen on the wildcard address (see\nX11UseLocalhost\n), though this is not the\ndefault. Additionally, the authentication spoofing and authentication\ndata verification and substitution occur on the client side. The\nsecurity risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display\nserver may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding\n(see the warnings for\nForwardX11\nin\nssh_config(5)\n). A system administrator may have a stance in which\nthey want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by\nunwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a\nno\nsetting.\nNote that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent users from\nforwarding X11 traffic, as users can always install their own\nforwarders.\nX11UseLocalhost\nSpecifies whether\nsshd(8)\nshould bind the X11 forwarding server to the loopback\naddress or to the wildcard address. By default, sshd binds the forwarding\nserver to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the\nDISPLAY\nenvironment variable to\nlocalhost\n. This prevents remote hosts from\nconnecting to the proxy display. However, some older X11 clients may not\nfunction with this configuration.\nX11UseLocalhost\nmay be set to\nno\nto specify that the forwarding\nserver should be bound to the wildcard address. The argument must be\nyes\nor\nno\n. The default is\nyes\n.\nXAuthLocation\nSpecifies the full pathname of the\nxauth(1)\nprogram, or\nnone\nto not use one. The default is\n/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth\n.\nTIME\nFORMATS\nsshd(8)\ncommand-line arguments and configuration file options that\nspecify time may be expressed using a sequence of the form:\ntime\n[\nqualifier\n], where\ntime\nis a positive integer value and\nqualifier\nis one of the following:\n⟨\nnone\n⟩\nseconds\ns\n|\nS\nseconds\nm\n|\nM\nminutes\nh\n|\nH\nhours\nd\n|\nD\ndays\nw\n|\nW\nweeks\nEach member of the sequence is added together to calculate the\ntotal time value.\nTime format examples:\n600\n600 seconds (10 minutes)\n10m\n10 minutes\n1h30m\n1 hour 30 minutes (90 minutes)\nTOKENS\nArguments to some keywords can make use of tokens, which are\nexpanded at runtime:\n%%\nA literal ‘%’.\n%C\nIdentifies the connection endpoints, containing four space-separated\nvalues: client address, client port number, server address, and server\nport number.\n%D\nThe routing domain in which the incoming connection was received.\n%F\nThe fingerprint of the CA key.\n%f\nThe fingerprint of the key or certificate.\n%h\nThe home directory of the user.\n%i\nThe key ID in the certificate.\n%K\nThe base64-encoded CA key.\n%k\nThe base64-encoded key or certificate for authentication.\n%s\nThe serial number of the certificate.\n%T\nThe type of the CA key.\n%t\nThe key or certificate type.\n%U\nThe numeric user ID of the target user.\n%u\nThe username.\nAuthorizedKeysCommand\naccepts the tokens\n%%, %C, %D, %f, %h, %k, %t, %U, and %u.\nAuthorizedKeysFile\naccepts the tokens %%,\n%h, %U, and %u.\nAuthorizedPrincipalsCommand\naccepts the\ntokens %%, %C, %D, %F, %f, %h, %i, %K, %k, %s, %T, %t, %U, and %u.\nAuthorizedPrincipalsFile\naccepts the\ntokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.\nChrootDirectory\naccepts the tokens %%, %h,\n%U, and %u.\nRoutingDomain\naccepts the token %D.\nFILES\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\nContains configuration data for\nsshd(8)\n.\nThis file should be writable by root only, but it is recommended (though\nnot necessary) that it be world-readable.\nSEE\nALSO\nsftp-server(8)\n,\nsshd(8)\nAUTHORS\nOpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12\nrelease by\nTatu Ylonen\n.\nAaron\nCampbell\n,\nBob Beck\n,\nMarkus\nFriedl\n,\nNiels Provos\n,\nTheo\nde Raadt\nand\nDug Song\nremoved many bugs,\nre-added newer features and created OpenSSH.\nMarkus\nFriedl\ncontributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.\nNiels Provos\nand\nMarkus\nFriedl\ncontributed support for privilege separation.\nNovember 25,\n2025\nOpenBSD-current", "metadata": {"source_type": "vendor_docs", "trust": "vendor_docs", "os": "linux", "distro": "ubuntu-22.04", "license": "CC BY-SA (assumed; verify per site)", "attribution_url": "https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config"}}

If invoked without any arguments,\nssh-keygen\nwill generate an Ed25519 key.\nssh-keygen\nis also used to generate groups\nfor use in Diffie-Hellman group exchange (DH-GEX). See the\nMODULI GENERATION\nsection for\ndetails.\nFinally,\nssh-keygen\ncan be used to\ngenerate and update Key Revocation Lists, and to test whether given keys\nhave been revoked by one. See the\nKEY REVOCATION LISTS\nsection\nfor details.\nNormally each user wishing to use SSH with public key\nauthentication runs this once to create the authentication key in\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa\n,\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk\n,\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n,\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk\nor\n~/.ssh/id_rsa\n. Additionally, the system\nadministrator may use this to generate host keys, as seen in\n/etc/rc\n.\nNormally this program generates the key and asks for a file in\nwhich to store the private key. The public key is stored in a file with the\nsame name but “.pub” appended. The program also asks for a\npassphrase. The passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys\nmust have an empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length. A\npassphrase is similar to a password, except it can be a phrase with a series\nof words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of characters you\nwant. Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences\nor otherwise easily guessable (English prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy\nper character, and provides very bad passphrases), and contain a mix of\nupper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. The\npassphrase can be changed later by using the\n-p\noption.\nThere is no way to recover a lost passphrase. If the passphrase is\nlost or forgotten, a new key must be generated and the corresponding public\nkey copied to other machines.\nssh-keygen\nwill by default write keys in\nan OpenSSH-specific format. This format is preferred as it offers better\nprotection for keys at rest as well as allowing storage of key comments\nwithin the private key file itself. The key comment may be useful to help\nidentify the key. The comment is initialized to “user@host”\nwhen the key is created, but can be changed using the\n-c\noption.\nIt is still possible for\nssh-keygen\nto\nwrite the previously-used PEM format private keys using the\n-m\nflag. This may be used when generating new keys,\nand existing new-format keys may be converted using this option in\nconjunction with the\n-p\n(change passphrase)\nflag.\nAfter a key is generated,\nssh-keygen\nwill\nask where the keys should be placed to be activated.\nThe options are as follows:\n-A\nGenerate host keys of all default key types (rsa, ecdsa, and ed25519) if\nthey do not already exist. The host keys are generated with the default\nkey file path, an empty passphrase, default bits for the key type, and\ndefault comment. If\n-f\nhas also been specified,\nits argument is used as a prefix to the default path for the resulting\nhost key files. This is used by\n/etc/rc\nto\ngenerate new host keys.\n-a\nrounds\nWhen saving a private key, this option specifies the number of KDF (key\nderivation function, currently\nbcrypt_pbkdf(3)\n) rounds used. Higher numbers result in slower\npassphrase verification and increased resistance to brute-force password\ncracking (should the keys be stolen). The default is 16 rounds.\n-B\nShow the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key file.\n-b\nbits\nSpecifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the\nminimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 3072 bits. Generally, 3072\nbits is considered sufficient. For ECDSA keys, the\n-b\nflag determines the key length by selecting\nfrom one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521 bits. Attempting\nto use bit lengths other than these three values for ECDSA keys will fail.\nECDSA-SK, Ed25519 and Ed25519-SK keys have a fixed length and the\n-b\nflag will be ignored.\n-C\ncomment\nProvides a new comment.\n-c\nRequests changing the comment in the private and public key files. The\nprogram will prompt for the file containing the private keys, for the\npassphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.\n-D\npkcs11\nDownload the public keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library\npkcs11\n. When used in combination with\n-s\n, this option indicates that a CA key resides in\na PKCS#11 token (see the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection for\ndetails).\n-E\nfingerprint_hash\nSpecifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid\noptions are: “md5” and “sha256”. The default\nis “sha256”.\n-e\nThis option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and print to\nstdout a public key in one of the formats specified by the\n-m\noption. The default export format is\n“RFC4716”. This option allows exporting OpenSSH keys for use\nby other programs, including several commercial SSH implementations.\n-F\nhostname\n|\n[hostname]:port\nSearch for the specified\nhostname\n(with optional\nport number) in a\nknown_hosts\nfile, listing any\noccurrences found. This option is useful to find hashed host names or\naddresses and may also be used in conjunction with the\n-H\noption to print found keys in a hashed\nformat.\n-f\nfilename\nSpecifies the filename of the key file.\n-g\nUse generic DNS format when printing fingerprint resource records using\nthe\n-r\ncommand.\n-H\nHash a\nknown_hosts\nfile. This replaces all\nhostnames and addresses with hashed representations within the specified\nfile; the original content is moved to a file with a .old suffix. These\nhashes may be used normally by\nssh\nand\nsshd\n, but they do not reveal identifying\ninformation should the file's contents be disclosed. This option will not\nmodify existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe to use on files\nthat mix hashed and non-hashed names.\n-h\nWhen signing a key, create a host certificate instead of a user\ncertificate. See the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection for details.\n-I\ncertificate_identity\nSpecify the key identity when signing a public key. See the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection for\ndetails.\n-i\nThis option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file in the\nformat specified by the\n-m\noption and print an\nOpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout. This option allows\nimporting keys from other software, including several commercial SSH\nimplementations. The default import format is\n“RFC4716”.\n-K\nDownload resident keys from a FIDO authenticator. Public and private key\nfiles will be written to the current directory for each downloaded key. If\nmultiple FIDO authenticators are attached, keys will be downloaded from\nthe first touched authenticator. See the\nFIDO AUTHENTICATOR\nsection\nfor more information.\n-k\nGenerate a KRL file. In this mode,\nssh-keygen\nwill\ngenerate a KRL file at the location specified via the\n-f\nflag that revokes every key or certificate\npresented on the command line. Keys/certificates to be revoked may be\nspecified by public key file or using the format described in the\nKEY REVOCATION LISTS\nsection.\n-L\nPrints the contents of one or more certificates.\n-l\nShow fingerprint of specified public key file.\nssh-keygen\nwill try to find the matching public\nkey file and prints its fingerprint. If combined with\n-v\n, a visual ASCII art representation of the key\nis supplied with the fingerprint.\n-M\ngenerate\nGenerate candidate Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange (DH-GEX) parameters for\neventual use by the ‘diffie-hellman-group-exchange-*’ key\nexchange methods. The numbers generated by this operation must be further\nscreened before use. See the\nMODULI GENERATION\nsection for\nmore information.\n-M\nscreen\nScreen candidate parameters for Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange. This will\naccept a list of candidate numbers and test that they are safe (Sophie\nGermain) primes with acceptable group generators. The results of this\noperation may be added to the\n/etc/moduli\nfile.\nSee the\nMODULI GENERATION\nsection for more information.\n-m\nkey_format\nSpecify a key format for key generation, the\n-i\n(import),\n-e\n(export) conversion options, and the\n-p\nchange passphrase operation. The latter may be\nused to convert between OpenSSH private key and PEM private key formats.\nThe supported key formats are: “RFC4716” (RFC 4716/SSH2\npublic or private key), “PKCS8” (PKCS8 public or private\nkey) or “PEM” (PEM public key). By default OpenSSH will\nwrite newly-generated private keys in its own format, but when converting\npublic keys for export the default format is “RFC4716”.\nSetting a format of “PEM” when generating or updating a\nsupported private key type will cause the key to be stored in the legacy\nPEM private key format.\n-N\nnew_passphrase\nProvides the new passphrase.\n-n\nprincipals\nSpecify one or more principals (user or host names) to be included in a\ncertificate when signing a key. Multiple principals may be specified,\nseparated by commas. See the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection for\ndetails.\n-O\noption\nSpecify a key/value option. These are specific to the operation that\nssh-keygen\nhas been requested to perform.\nWhen signing certificates, one of the options listed in the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection may be\nspecified here.\nWhen performing moduli generation or screening, one of the\noptions listed in the\nMODULI\nGENERATION\nsection may be specified.\nWhen generating FIDO authenticator-backed keys, the options\nlisted in the\nFIDO\nAUTHENTICATOR\nsection may be specified.\nWhen performing signature-related options using the\n-Y\nflag, the following options are accepted:\nhashalg\n=\nalgorithm\nSelects the hash algorithm to use for hashing the message to be\nsigned. Valid algorithms are “sha256” and\n“sha512.” The default is “sha512.”\nprint-pubkey\nPrint the full public key to standard output after signature\nverification.\nverify-time\n=\ntimestamp\nSpecifies a time to use when validating signatures instead of the\ncurrent time. The time may be specified as a date or time in the\nYYYYMMDD[Z] or in YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z] formats. Dates and times will be\ninterpreted in the current system time zone unless suffixed with a Z\ncharacter, which causes them to be interpreted in the UTC time\nzone.\nWhen generating SSHFP DNS records from public keys using the\n-r\nflag, the following options are accepted:\nhashalg\n=\nalgorithm\nSelects a hash algorithm to use when printing SSHFP records using the\n-D\nflag. Valid algorithms are\n“sha1” and “sha256”. The default is to\nprint both.\nThe\n-O\noption may be specified\nmultiple times.\n-P\npassphrase\nProvides the (old) passphrase.\n-p\nRequests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of creating\na new private key. The program will prompt for the file containing the\nprivate key, for the old passphrase, and twice for the new\npassphrase.\n-Q\nTest whether keys have been revoked in a KRL. If the\n-l\noption is also specified then the contents of\nthe KRL will be printed.\n-q\nSilence\nssh-keygen\n.\n-R\nhostname\n|\n[hostname]:port\nRemoves all keys belonging to the specified\nhostname\n(with optional port number) from a\nknown_hosts\nfile. This option is useful to delete hashed hosts (see the\n-H\noption above).\n-r\nhostname\nPrint the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named\nhostname\nfor the specified public key file.\n-s\nca_key\nCertify (sign) a public key using the specified CA key. See the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection for details.\nWhen generating a KRL,\n-s\nspecifies a\npath to a CA public key file used to revoke certificates directly by key\nID or serial number. See the\nKEY REVOCATION LISTS\nsection for details.\n-t\necdsa\n|\necdsa-sk\n|\ned25519\n|\ned25519-sk\n|\nrsa\nSpecifies the type of key to create. The possible values are\n“ecdsa”, “ecdsa-sk”, “ed25519 (the\ndefault),” “ed25519-sk”, or “rsa”.\nThis flag may also be used to specify the desired signature\ntype when signing certificates using an RSA CA key. The available RSA\nsignature variants are “ssh-rsa” (SHA1 signatures, not\nrecommended), “rsa-sha2-256”, and\n“rsa-sha2-512” (the default for RSA keys).\n-U\nWhen used in combination with\n-s\nor\n-Y\nsign\n, this option\nindicates that a CA key resides in an\nssh-agent(1)\n. See the\nCERTIFICATES\nsection for more\ninformation.\n-u\nUpdate a KRL. When specified with\n-k\n, keys listed\nvia the command line are added to the existing KRL rather than a new KRL\nbeing created.\n-V\nvalidity_interval\nSpecify a validity interval when signing a certificate. A validity\ninterval may consist of a single time, indicating that the certificate is\nvalid beginning now and expiring at that time, or may consist of two times\nseparated by a colon to indicate an explicit time interval.\nThe start time may be specified as:\nThe string “always” to indicate the certificate has no\nspecified start time.\nA date or time in the system time zone formatted as YYYYMMDD or\nYYYYMMDDHHMM[SS].\nA date or time in the UTC time zone as YYYYMMDDZ or\nYYYYMMDDHHMM[SS]Z.\nA relative time before the current system time consisting of a minus\nsign followed by an interval in the format described in the TIME\nFORMATS section of\nsshd_config(5)\n.\nA raw seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC) as a hexadecimal\nnumber beginning with “0x”.\nThe end time may be specified similarly to the start time:\nThe string “forever” to indicate the certificate has no\nspecified end time.\nA date or time in the system time zone formatted as YYYYMMDD or\nYYYYMMDDHHMM[SS].\nA date or time in the UTC time zone as YYYYMMDDZ or\nYYYYMMDDHHMM[SS]Z.\nA relative time after the current system time consisting of a plus\nsign followed by an interval in the format described in the TIME\nFORMATS section of\nsshd_config(5)\n.\nA raw seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC) as a hexadecimal\nnumber beginning with “0x”.\nFor example:\n+52w1d\nValid from now to 52 weeks and one day from now.\n-4w:+4w\nValid from four weeks ago to four weeks from now.\n20100101123000:20110101123000\nValid from 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2010 to 12:30 PM, January 1st,\n2011.\n20100101123000Z:20110101123000Z\nSimilar, but interpreted in the UTC time zone rather than the system\ntime zone.\n-1d:20110101\nValid from yesterday to midnight, January 1st, 2011.\n0x1:0x2000000000\nValid from roughly early 1970 to May 2033.\n-1m:forever\nValid from one minute ago and never expiring.\n-v\nVerbose mode. Causes\nssh-keygen\nto print debugging\nmessages about its progress. This is helpful for debugging moduli\ngeneration. Multiple\n-v\noptions increase the\nverbosity. The maximum is 3.\n-w\nprovider\nSpecifies a path to a library that will be used when creating FIDO\nauthenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the internal\nUSB HID support.\n-Y\nfind-principals\nFind the principal(s) associated with the public key of a signature,\nprovided using the\n-s\nflag in an authorized\nsigners file provided using the\n-f\nflag. The\nformat of the allowed signers file is documented in the\nALLOWED SIGNERS\nsection below.\nIf one or more matching principals are found, they are returned on\nstandard output.\n-Y\nmatch-principals\nFind principal matching the principal name provided using the\n-I\nflag in the authorized signers file specified\nusing the\n-f\nflag. If one or more matching\nprincipals are found, they are returned on standard output.\n-Y\ncheck-novalidate\nChecks that a signature generated using\nssh-keygen\n-Y\nsign\nhas a valid\nstructure. This does not validate if a signature comes from an authorized\nsigner. When testing a signature,\nssh-keygen\naccepts a message on standard input and a signature namespace using\n-n\n. A file containing the corresponding signature\nmust also be supplied using the\n-s\nflag.\nSuccessful testing of the signature is signalled by\nssh-keygen\nreturning a zero exit status.\n-Y\nsign\nCryptographically sign a file or some data using an SSH key. When signing,\nssh-keygen\naccepts zero or more files to sign on\nthe command-line - if no files are specified then\nssh-keygen\nwill sign data presented on standard\ninput. Signatures are written to the path of the input file with\n“.sig” appended, or to standard output if the message to be\nsigned was read from standard input.\nThe key used for signing is specified using the\n-f\noption and may refer to either a private key,\nor a public key with the private half available via\nssh-agent(1)\n. An additional signature namespace, used to prevent\nsignature confusion across different domains of use (e.g. file signing\nvs email signing) must be provided via the\n-n\nflag. Namespaces are arbitrary strings, and may include:\n“file” for file signing, “email” for email\nsigning. For custom uses, it is recommended to use names following a\nNAMESPACE@YOUR.DOMAIN pattern to generate unambiguous namespaces.\n-Y\nverify\nRequest to verify a signature generated using\nssh-keygen\n-Y\nsign\nas described above. When verifying a\nsignature,\nssh-keygen\naccepts a message on\nstandard input and a signature namespace using\n-n\n.\nA file containing the corresponding signature must also be supplied using\nthe\n-s\nflag, along with the identity of the signer\nusing\n-I\nand a list of allowed signers via the\n-f\nflag. The format of the allowed signers file is\ndocumented in the\nALLOWED\nSIGNERS\nsection below. A file containing revoked keys can be passed\nusing the\n-r\nflag. The revocation file may be a\nKRL or a one-per-line list of public keys. Successful verification by an\nauthorized signer is signalled by\nssh-keygen\nreturning a zero exit status.\n-y\nThis option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH\npublic key to stdout.\n-Z\ncipher\nSpecifies the cipher to use for encryption when writing an OpenSSH-format\nprivate key file. The list of available ciphers may be obtained using\n\"ssh -Q cipher\". The default is “aes256-ctr”.\n-z\nserial_number\nSpecifies a serial number to be embedded in the certificate to distinguish\nthis certificate from others from the same CA. If the\nserial_number\nis prefixed with a ‘+’\ncharacter, then the serial number will be incremented for each certificate\nsigned on a single command-line. The default serial number is zero.\nWhen generating a KRL, the\n-z\nflag is\nused to specify a KRL version number.\nMODULI\nGENERATION\nssh-keygen\nmay be used to generate groups\nfor the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange (DH-GEX) protocol. Generating these\ngroups is a two-step process: first, candidate primes are generated using a\nfast, but memory intensive process. These candidate primes are then tested\nfor suitability (a CPU-intensive process).\nGeneration of primes is performed using the\n-M\ngenerate\noption. The\ndesired length of the primes may be specified by the\n-O\nbits\noption. For\nexample:\n# ssh-keygen -M generate -O bits=2048\nmoduli-2048.candidates\nBy default, the search for primes begins at a random point in the\ndesired length range. This may be overridden using the\n-O\nstart\noption, which\nspecifies a different start point (in hex).\nOnce a set of candidates have been generated, they must be\nscreened for suitability. This may be performed using the\n-M\nscreen\noption. In this\nmode\nssh-keygen\nwill read candidates from standard\ninput (or a file specified using the\n-f\noption). For\nexample:\n# ssh-keygen -M screen -f\nmoduli-2048.candidates moduli-2048\nBy default, each candidate will be subjected to 100 primality\ntests. This may be overridden using the\n-O\nprime-tests\noption. The DH generator value will be\nchosen automatically for the prime under consideration. If a specific\ngenerator is desired, it may be requested using the\n-O\ngenerator\noption. Valid\ngenerator values are 2, 3, and 5.\nScreened DH groups may be installed in\n/etc/moduli\n. It is important that this file contains\nmoduli of a range of bit lengths.\nA number of options are available for moduli generation and\nscreening via the\n-O\nflag:\nlines\n=\nnumber\nExit after screening the specified number of lines while performing DH\ncandidate screening.\nstart-line\n=\nline-number\nStart screening at the specified line number while performing DH candidate\nscreening.\ncheckpoint\n=\nfilename\nWrite the last line processed to the specified file while performing DH\ncandidate screening. This will be used to skip lines in the input file\nthat have already been processed if the job is restarted.\nstart\n=\nhex-value\nSpecify start point (in hex) when generating candidate moduli for\nDH-GEX.\ngenerator\n=\nvalue\nSpecify desired generator (in decimal) when testing candidate moduli for\nDH-GEX.\nCERTIFICATES\nssh-keygen\nsupports signing of keys to\nproduce certificates that may be used for user or host authentication.\nCertificates consist of a public key, some identity information, zero or\nmore principal (user or host) names and a set of options that are signed by\na Certification Authority (CA) key. Clients or servers may then trust only\nthe CA key and verify its signature on a certificate rather than trusting\nmany user/host keys. Note that OpenSSH certificates are a different, and\nmuch simpler, format to the X.509 certificates used in\nssl(8)\n.\nssh-keygen\nsupports two types of\ncertificates: user and host. User certificates authenticate users to\nservers, whereas host certificates authenticate server hosts to users. To\ngenerate a user certificate:\n$ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I\nkey_id /path/to/user_key.pub\nThe resultant certificate will be placed in\n/path/to/user_key-cert.pub\n. A host certificate\nrequires the\n-h\noption:\n$ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I\nkey_id -h /path/to/host_key.pub\nThe host certificate will be output to\n/path/to/host_key-cert.pub\n.\nIt is possible to sign using a CA key stored in a PKCS#11 token by\nproviding the token library using\n-D\nand identifying\nthe CA key by providing its public half as an argument to\n-s\n:\n$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key.pub -D\nlibpkcs11.so -I key_id user_key.pub\nSimilarly, it is possible for the CA key to be hosted in an\nssh-agent(1)\n. This is indicated by the\n-U\nflag and, again, the CA key must be identified by its public half.\n$ ssh-keygen -Us ca_key.pub -I key_id\nuser_key.pub\nIn all cases,\nkey_id\nis a \"key\nidentifier\" that is logged by the server when the certificate is used\nfor authentication.\nCertificates may be limited to be valid for a set of principal\n(user/host) names. By default, generated certificates are valid for all\nusers or hosts. To generate a certificate for a specified set of\nprincipals:\n$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -n\nuser1,user2 user_key.pub\n$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -h\n-n host.domain host_key.pub\nAdditional limitations on the validity and use of user\ncertificates may be specified through certificate options. A certificate\noption may disable features of the SSH session, may be valid only when\npresented from particular source addresses or may force the use of a\nspecific command.\nThe options that are valid for user certificates are:\nclear\nClear all enabled permissions. This is useful for clearing the default set\nof permissions so permissions may be added individually.\ncritical\n:\nname\n[=\ncontents\n]\nextension\n:\nname\n[=\ncontents\n]\nIncludes an arbitrary certificate critical option or extension. The\nspecified\nname\nshould include a domain suffix, e.g.\n“name@example.com”. If\ncontents\nis\nspecified then it is included as the contents of the extension/option\nencoded as a string, otherwise the extension/option is created with no\ncontents (usually indicating a flag). Extensions may be ignored by a\nclient or server that does not recognise them, whereas unknown critical\noptions will cause the certificate to be refused.\nforce-command\n=\ncommand\nForces the execution of\ncommand\ninstead of any shell\nor command specified by the user when the certificate is used for\nauthentication.\nno-agent-forwarding\nDisable\nssh-agent(1)\nforwarding (permitted by default).\nno-port-forwarding\nDisable port forwarding (permitted by default).\nno-pty\nDisable PTY allocation (permitted by default).\nno-user-rc\nDisable execution of\n~/.ssh/rc\nby\nsshd(8)\n(permitted by default).\nno-x11-forwarding\nDisable X11 forwarding (permitted by default).\npermit-agent-forwarding\nAllows\nssh-agent(1)\nforwarding.\npermit-port-forwarding\nAllows port forwarding.\npermit-pty\nAllows PTY allocation.\npermit-user-rc\nAllows execution of\n~/.ssh/rc\nby\nsshd(8)\n.\npermit-X11-forwarding\nAllows X11 forwarding.\nno-touch-required\nDo not require signatures made using this key include demonstration of\nuser presence (e.g. by having the user touch the authenticator). This\noption only makes sense for the FIDO authenticator algorithms\necdsa-sk\nand\ned25519-sk\n.\nsource-address\n=\naddress_list\nRestrict the source addresses from which the certificate is considered\nvalid. The\naddress_list\nis a comma-separated list of\none or more address/netmask pairs in CIDR format.\nverify-required\nRequire signatures made using this key indicate that the user was first\nverified, e.g. by PIN or on-token biometrics. This option only makes sense\nfor the FIDO authenticator algorithms\necdsa-sk\nand\ned25519-sk\n.\nAt present, no standard options are valid for host keys.\nFinally, certificates may be defined with a validity lifetime. The\n-V\noption allows specification of certificate start\nand end times. A certificate that is presented at a time outside this range\nwill not be considered valid. By default, certificates are valid from the\nUNIX\nEpoch to the distant future.\nFor certificates to be used for user or host authentication, the\nCA public key must be trusted by\nsshd(8)\nor\nssh(1)\n. Refer to\nthose manual pages for details.\nFIDO\nAUTHENTICATOR\nssh-keygen\nis able to generate FIDO\nauthenticator-backed keys, after which they may be used much like any other\nkey type supported by OpenSSH, so long as the hardware authenticator is\nattached when the keys are used. FIDO authenticators generally require the\nuser to explicitly authorise operations by touching or tapping them. FIDO\nkeys consist of two parts: a key handle part stored in the private key file\non disk, and a per-device private key that is unique to each FIDO\nauthenticator and that cannot be exported from the authenticator hardware.\nThese are combined by the hardware at authentication time to derive the real\nkey that is used to sign authentication challenges. Supported key types are\necdsa-sk\nand\ned25519-sk\n.\nThe options that are valid for FIDO keys are:\napplication\nOverride the default FIDO application/origin string of\n“ssh:”. This may be useful when generating host or\ndomain-specific resident keys. The specified application string must begin\nwith “ssh:”.\nchallenge\n=\npath\nSpecifies a path to a challenge string that will be passed to the FIDO\nauthenticator during key generation. The challenge string may be used as\npart of an out-of-band protocol for key enrollment (a random challenge is\nused by default).\ndevice\nExplicitly specify a\nfido(4)\ndevice to use, rather than letting the\nauthenticator middleware select one.\nno-touch-required\nIndicate that the generated private key should not require touch events\n(user presence) when making signatures. Note that\nsshd(8)\nwill\nrefuse such signatures by default, unless overridden via an\nauthorized_keys option.\nresident\nIndicate that the key handle should be stored on the FIDO authenticator\nitself. This makes it easier to use the authenticator on multiple\ncomputers. Resident keys may be supported on FIDO2 authenticators and\ntypically require that a PIN be set on the authenticator prior to\ngeneration. Resident keys may be loaded off the authenticator using\nssh-add(1)\n. Storing both parts of a key on a FIDO authenticator\nincreases the likelihood of an attacker being able to use a stolen\nauthenticator device.\nuser\nA username to be associated with a resident key, overriding the empty\ndefault username. Specifying a username may be useful when generating\nmultiple resident keys for the same application name.\nverify-required\nIndicate that this private key should require user verification for each\nsignature. Not all FIDO authenticators support this option. Currently PIN\nauthentication is the only supported verification method, but other\nmethods may be supported in the future.\nwrite-attestation\n=\npath\nMay be used at key generation time to record the attestation data returned\nfrom FIDO authenticators during key generation. This information is\npotentially sensitive. By default, this information is discarded.\nKEY\nREVOCATION LISTS\nssh-keygen\nis able to manage OpenSSH\nformat Key Revocation Lists (KRLs). These binary files specify keys or\ncertificates to be revoked using a compact format, taking as little as one\nbit per certificate if they are being revoked by serial number.\nKRLs may be generated using the\n-k\nflag.\nThis option reads one or more files from the command line and generates a\nnew KRL. The files may either contain a KRL specification (see below) or\npublic keys, listed one per line. Plain public keys are revoked by listing\ntheir hash or contents in the KRL and certificates revoked by serial number\nor key ID (if the serial is zero or not available).\nRevoking keys using a KRL specification offers explicit control\nover the types of record used to revoke keys and may be used to directly\nrevoke certificates by serial number or key ID without having the complete\noriginal certificate on hand. A KRL specification consists of lines\ncontaining one of the following directives followed by a colon and some\ndirective-specific information.\nserial\n:\nserial_number\n[-\nserial_number\n]\nRevokes a certificate with the specified serial number. Serial numbers are\n64-bit values, not including zero and may be expressed in decimal, hex or\noctal. If two serial numbers are specified separated by a hyphen, then the\nrange of serial numbers including and between each is revoked. The CA key\nmust have been specified on the\nssh-keygen\ncommand\nline using the\n-s\noption.\nid\n:\nkey_id\nRevokes a certificate with the specified key ID string. The CA key must\nhave been specified on the\nssh-keygen\ncommand line\nusing the\n-s\noption.\nkey\n:\npublic_key\nRevokes the specified key. If a certificate is listed, then it is revoked\nas a plain public key.\nsha1\n:\npublic_key\nRevokes the specified key by including its SHA1 hash in the KRL.\nsha256\n:\npublic_key\nRevokes the specified key by including its SHA256 hash in the KRL. KRLs\nthat revoke keys by SHA256 hash are not supported by OpenSSH versions\nprior to 7.9.\nhash\n:\nfingerprint\nRevokes a key using a fingerprint hash, as obtained from an\nsshd(8)\nauthentication log message or the\nssh-keygen\n-l\nflag. Only SHA256 fingerprints are supported\nhere and resultant KRLs are not supported by OpenSSH versions prior to\n7.9.\nKRLs may be updated using the\n-u\nflag in\naddition to\n-k\n. When this option is specified, keys\nlisted via the command line are merged into the KRL, adding to those already\nthere.\nIt is also possible, given a KRL, to test whether it revokes a\nparticular key (or keys). The\n-Q\nflag will query an\nexisting KRL, testing each key specified on the command line. If any key\nlisted on the command line has been revoked (or an error encountered) then\nssh-keygen\nwill exit with a non-zero exit status. A\nzero exit status will only be returned if no key was revoked.\nALLOWED\nSIGNERS\nWhen verifying signatures,\nssh-keygen\nuses\na simple list of identities and keys to determine whether a signature comes\nfrom an authorized source. This \"allowed signers\" file uses a\nformat patterned after the AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT described in\nsshd(8)\n. Each\nline of the file contains the following space-separated fields: principals,\noptions, keytype, base64-encoded key. Empty lines and lines starting with a\n‘\n#\n’ are ignored as comments.\nThe principals field is a pattern-list (see PATTERNS in\nssh_config(5)\n) consisting of one or more comma-separated USER@DOMAIN\nidentity patterns that are accepted for signing. When verifying, the\nidentity presented via the\n-I\noption must match a\nprincipals pattern in order for the corresponding key to be considered\nacceptable for verification.\nThe options (if present) consist of comma-separated option\nspecifications. No spaces are permitted, except within double quotes. The\nfollowing option specifications are supported (note that option keywords are\ncase-insensitive):\ncert-authority\nIndicates that this key is accepted as a certificate authority (CA) and\nthat certificates signed by this CA may be accepted for verification.\nnamespaces\n=namespace-list\nSpecifies a pattern-list of namespaces that are accepted for this key. If\nthis option is present, the signature namespace embedded in the signature\nobject and presented on the verification command-line must match the\nspecified list before the key will be considered acceptable.\nvalid-after\n=timestamp\nIndicates that the key is valid for use at or after the specified\ntimestamp, which may be a date or time in the YYYYMMDD[Z] or\nYYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z] formats. Dates and times will be interpreted in the\ncurrent system time zone unless suffixed with a Z character, which causes\nthem to be interpreted in the UTC time zone.\nvalid-before\n=timestamp\nIndicates that the key is valid for use at or before the specified\ntimestamp.\nWhen verifying signatures made by certificates, the expected\nprincipal name must match both the principals pattern in the allowed signers\nfile and the principals embedded in the certificate itself.\nAn example allowed signers file:\n# Comments allowed at start of line\nuser1@example.com,user2@example.com ssh-rsa AAAAX1...\n# A certificate authority, trusted for all principals in a domain.\n*@example.com cert-authority ssh-ed25519 AAAB4...\n# A key that is accepted only for file signing.\nuser2@example.com namespaces=\"file\" ssh-ed25519 AAA41...\nENVIRONMENT\nSSH_SK_PROVIDER\nSpecifies a path to a library that will be used when loading any FIDO\nauthenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the built-in\nUSB HID support.\nFILES\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa\n~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk\n~/.ssh/id_rsa\nContains the ECDSA, authenticator-hosted ECDSA, Ed25519,\nauthenticator-hosted Ed25519 or RSA authentication identity of the user.\nThis file should not be readable by anyone but the user. It is possible to\nspecify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase will be used\nto encrypt the private part of this file using 128-bit AES.

You may find you wish to leave (icmp) ping requests enabled to diagnose networking problems.\nIn order to disable ping (icmp) requests, you need to edit\n/etc/ufw/before.rules\nand remove the following lines:\n# ok icmp codes\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type source-quench -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type parameter-problem -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT\nor change the \"ACCEPT\" to \"DROP\"\n# ok icmp codes\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -j DROP\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type source-quench -j DROP\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded -j DROP\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type parameter-problem -j DROP\n-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\nDeny Access\nDeny by specific IP\nsudo ufw deny from <ip address>\nexample:\nTo block packets from 207.46.232.182:\nsudo ufw deny from 207.46.232.182\nDeny by specific port and IP address\nsudo ufw deny from <ip address> to <protocol> port <port number>\nexample:\ndeny ip address 192.168.0.1 access to port 22 for all protocols\nsudo ufw deny from 192.168.0.1 to any port 22\nWorking with numbered rules\nListing rules with a reference number\nYou may use status numbered to show the order and id number of rules:\nsudo ufw status numbered\nEditing numbered rules\nDelete numbered rule\nYou may then delete rules using the number. This will delete the first rule and rules will shift up to fill in the list.\nsudo ufw delete 1\nInsert numbered rule\nsudo ufw insert 1 allow from <ip address>\nAdvanced Example\nScenario:\nYou want to block access to port 22 from 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.7 but allow all other 192.168.0.x IPs to have access to port 22 using tcp\nsudo ufw deny from 192.168.0.1 to any port 22\nsudo ufw deny from 192.168.0.7 to any port 22\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 22 proto tcp\nThis puts the specific rules first and the generic second. Once a rule is matched the others will not be evaluated (see manual below) so you must put the specific rules first.\nAs rules change you may need to delete old rules to ensure that new rules are put in the proper order.\nTo check your rules orders you can check the status; for the scenario the output below is the desired output for the rules to work properly\nsudo ufw status\nFirewall loaded\nTo                         Action  From\n--                         ------  ----\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.1\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.1\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.7\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.7\n22:tcp                     ALLOW   192.168.0.0/24\nScenario change:\nYou want to block access to port 22 to 192.168.0.3 as well as 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.7.\nsudo ufw delete allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 22\nsudo ufw status\nFirewall loaded\nTo                         Action  From\n--                         ------  ----\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.1\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.1\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.7\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.7\nsudo ufw deny 192.168.0.3 to any port 22\nsudo ufw allow 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 22 proto tcp\nsudo ufw status\nFirewall loaded\nTo                         Action  From\n--                         ------  ----\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.1\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.1\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.7\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.7\n22:tcp                     DENY    192.168.0.3\n22:udp                     DENY    192.168.0.3\n22:tcp                     ALLOW   192.168.0.0/24\nIf you simply add the deny rule the allow would have been above it and been applied instead of the deny\nInterpreting Log Entries\nBased on the response to the post\nUFW log guide/tutorial ?\n.\nThe SPT and DPT values, along with SRC and DST values, will typically be the values you’ll focus on when analysing the firewall logs.\nPseudo Log Entry\nFeb  4 23:33:37 hostname kernel: [ 3529.289825] [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:aa:bb:cc:dd SRC=444.333.222.111 DST=111.222.333.444 LEN=103 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=52 ID=0 DF PROTO=UDP SPT=53 DPT=36427 LEN=83\nDate\nIt's good practice to watch the dates and times. If things are out of order or blocks of time are missing then an attacker probably messed with your logs.\nHostname\nThe server’s hostname\nUptime\nThe time in seconds since boot.\nLogged Event\nShort description of the logged event; e.g. [UFW BLOCK]\nIN\nIf set, then the event was an incoming event.\nOUT\nIf set, then the event was an outgoing event.\nMAC\nThis provides a 14-byte combination of the Destination MAC, Source MAC, and\nEtherType\nfields, following the order found in the Ethernet II header. See\nEthernet frame\nand\nEtherType\nfor more information.\nSRC\nThis indicates the source IP, who sent the packet initially. Some IPs are routable over the internet, some will only communicate over a LAN, and some will only route back to the source computer. See\nIP address\nfor more information.\nDST\nThis indicates the destination IP, who is meant to receive the packet. You can use\nwhois.net\nor the cli\nwhois\nto determine the owner of the IP address.\nLEN\nThis indicates the length of the packet.\nTOS\nI believe this refers to the TOS field of the IPv4 header. See\nTCP Processing of the IPv4 Precedence Field\nfor more information.\nPREC\nI believe this refers to the Precedence field of the IPv4 header.\nTTL\nThis indicates the “Time to live” for the packet. Basically each packet will only bounce through the given number of routers before it dies and disappears. If it hasn’t found its destination before the TTL expires, then the packet will evaporate. This field keeps lost packets from clogging the internet forever. See\nTime to live\nfor more information.\nID\nNot sure what this one is, but it's not really important for reading logs. It might be ufw’s internal ID system, it might be the operating system’s ID.\nPROTO\nThis indicates the protocol of the packet - TCP or UDP. See\nTCP and UDP Ports Explained\nfor more information.\nSPT\nThis indicates the source. I believe this is the port, which the SRC IP sent the IP packet over. See\nList of TCP and UDP port numbers\nfor more information.\nDPT\nThis indicates the destination port. I believe this is the port, which the SRC IP sent its IP packet to, expecting a service to be running on this port.\nWINDOW\nThis indicates the size of packet the sender is willing to receive.\nRES\nThis bit is reserved for future use & is always set to 0. Basically it’s irrelevant for log reading purposes.\nSYN URGP\nSYN indicates that this connection requires a three-way handshake, which is typical of TCP connections. URGP indicates whether the urgent pointer field is relevant. 0 means it's not. Doesn’t really matter for firewall log reading.\nIP Blocklist for UFW\nIf your Ubuntu system is directly exposed to the internet, either via a public IP address or port forwarding, an IP blocklist will add another layer of protection. I created a couple of scripts that integrate with ufw and update the list daily. Full details are available on the\nGitHub\nproject:\nhttps://github.com/poddmo/ufw-blocklist\n.\nOther Resources\nFor instructions on using ufw first see the\nofficial server guide\n.\nThe most recent syntax and manual can be retrieved by getting the\nman page\n. Otherwise open a terminal window and type:\nman ufw\nFirewall\n- wiki homepage for firewall related documentation.\nIptables\n- interface to the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel.\nUncomplicatedFirewall\n- UFW Project wiki page.\nGufw\n- Graphic User Interface for UFW.\nCategoryNetworking\nCategorySecurity\nUFW  (last edited 2023-09-27 04:37:13 by\npoddmo\n)\nThe material on this wiki is available under a free license, see\nCopyright / License\nfor details\nYou\ncan contribute to this wiki, see\nWiki Guide\nfor details", "metadata": {"source_type": "vendor_docs", "trust": "vendor_docs", "os": "linux", "distro": "ubuntu-22.04", "license": "CC BY-SA (assumed; verify per site)", "attribution_url": "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW"}}

Hitachi disks (at least some of them) store power-on lifetime in minutes, rather than hours.\nIBM disks (at least some of them) have three temperatures stored in the raw structure, not just one. And so on.\nBruce Allen said on\n​\nsmartmontools-support list\n(2007-08-31):\nThe raw values for certain Attributes have vendor-specific meanings and are hard to interpret unless you know exactly how the vendor uses them on that specific disk model. The bit pattern might be a mix of flags, counters, and bitmasks, for example, leading to large and strange numbers. I wouldn't worry about the raw values very much. The normalized values (VALUE/WORST/THRESH) should have a sensible interpretation.\nNevertheless smartmontools have a new EXPERIMENTAL feature to log\nAttributes Raw Data\nin external files. See option\n--attributelog\nin smartd manpage and read the\nauthors instructions\n.\nFranc Zabkar has a special interest in deciphering raw values.
