With minimal configuration, the AWS CLI\nenables you to start running commands that implement functionality equivalent to that\nprovided by the browser-based AWS Management Console from the command prompt in your terminal\nprogram:\nLinux shells\nâ Use common shell programs\nsuch as\nbash\n,\nzsh\n, and\ntcsh\nto run commands in\nLinux or macOS.\nWindows command line\nâ On Windows, run\ncommands at the Windows command prompt or in PowerShell.\nRemotely\nâ Run commands on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n(Amazon EC2) instances through a remote terminal program such as PuTTY or SSH, or with\nAWS Systems Manager.\nAll IaaS (infrastructure as a service) AWS administration, management, and access\nfunctions in the AWS Management Console are available in the AWS API and AWS CLI. New AWS IaaS features\nand services provide full AWS Management Console functionality through the API and CLI at launch or\nwithin 180 days of launch.\nThe AWS CLI provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services. You can explore a\nservice's capabilities with the AWS CLI, and develop shell scripts to manage your resources.\nIn addition to the low-level, API-equivalent commands, several AWS services provide\ncustomizations for the AWS CLI. Customizations can include higher-level commands that simplify\nusing a service with a complex API.\nAbout\nAWS CLI version 2\nThe AWS CLI version 2 is the most recent major version of the AWS CLI and supports all of the\nlatest features. Some features introduced in version 2 are not backported to version 1\nand you must upgrade to access those features. There are some \"breaking\" changes from\nversion 1 that might require you to change your scripts. For a list of breaking changes\nin version 2, see\nMigration guide for the AWS CLI version 2\n.\nThe AWS CLI version 2 is available to install only as a bundled installer. While you might find\nit in package managers, these are unsupported and unofficial packages that are not\nproduced or managed by AWS. We recommend that you install the AWS CLI from only the\nofficial AWS distribution points, as documented in this guide.\nTo install the AWS CLI version 2, see\nInstalling or updating to the latest version of\nthe AWS CLI\n.\nTo check the currently installed version, use the following command:\n$\naws --version\naws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Linux/5.10.205-195.807.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/1.18.6\nFor version history, see the\nAWS CLI version 2\nChangelog\non\nGitHub\n.\nMaintenance and support for SDK major versions\nFor information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying\ndependencies, see the following in the\nAWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide\n:\nAWS SDKs and tools\nmaintenance policy\nAWS SDKs and\ntools version support matrix\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of digital infrastructure\nservices that developers can leverage when developing their applications.\nThe services include computing, storage, database, and application\nsynchronization (messaging and queuing). AWS uses a pay-as-you-go service model.\nYou are charged only for the services that youâor your applicationsâuse.\nAlso, to make AWS more approachable as a platform for prototyping and\nexperimentation, AWS offers a free usage tier. On this tier, services are free below\na certain level of usage.\nFor more information about AWS costs and the Free Tier, see\nAWS Free Tier\n.\nTo obtain an AWS account, open the\nAWS home page\nand then choose\nCreate an AWS Account\n.\nJavascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.\nTo use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.

The following settings are used:\n(Required)\nsso_start_url\n(Required)\nsso_region\nsso_account_id\nsso_role_name\nsso_registration_scopes\nYou define an\nsso-session\nsection and associate it to a profile.\nsso_region\nand\nsso_start_url\nmust be set within the\nsso-session\nsection. Typically,\nsso_account_id\nand\nsso_role_name\nmust be set in the\nprofile\nsection so\nthat the SDK can request SSO credentials.\nThe following example configures the SDK to request SSO credentials and supports\nautomated token refresh:\n[profile\ndev\n]\nsso_session =\nmy-sso\nsso_account_id =\n111122223333\nsso_role_name =\nSampleRole\n[sso-session\nmy-sso\n]\nsso_region =\nus-east-1\nsso_start_url =\nhttps://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nThis also allows\nsso-session\nconfigurations to be reused across\nmultiple profiles:\n[profile\ndev\n]\nsso_session =\nmy-sso\nsso_account_id =\n111122223333\nsso_role_name =\nSampleRole\n[profile\nprod\n]\nsso_session =\nmy-sso\nsso_account_id =\n111122223333\nsso_role_name =\nSampleRole2\n[sso-session\nmy-sso\n]\nsso_region =\nus-east-1\nsso_start_url =\nhttps://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nHowever,\nsso_account_id\nand\nsso_role_name\naren't\nrequired for all scenarios of SSO token configuration. If your application only uses\nAWS services that support bearer authentication, then traditional AWS\ncredentials are not needed. Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme\nthat uses security tokens called bearer tokens. In this scenario,\nsso_account_id\nand\nsso_role_name\naren't required. See\nthe individual guide for your AWS service to determine if it supports bearer token\nauthorization.\nAdditionally, registration scopes can be configured as part of a\nsso-session\n. Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an\napplication's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more\nscopes, and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes\ngranted. These scopes define the permissions requested to be authorized for the\nregistered OIDC client and access tokens retrieved by the client. The following\nexample sets\nsso_registration_scopes\nto provide access for listing\naccounts/roles:\n[sso-session\nmy-sso\n]\nsso_region =\nus-east-1\nsso_start_url =\nhttps://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nsso_registration_scopes =\nsso:account:access\nThe authentication token is cached to disk under the\n~/.aws/sso/cache\ndirectory with a filename based on the\nsession name.\nFor more information on this configuration type, see\nConfiguring IAM Identity Center authentication with the AWS CLI\n.\nSection type:\nservices\nThe\nservices\nsection is a group of settings that configures custom\nendpoints for AWS service requests. A profile then is linked to a\nservices\nsection.\n[profile\ndev\n]\nservices =\nmy-services\nThe\nservices\nsection is separated into subsections by\n<SERVICE> =\nlines, where\n<SERVICE>\nis the\nAWS service identifier key. The AWS service identifier is based on the API\nmodelâs\nserviceId\nby replacing all spaces with underscores and\nlowercasing all letters. For a list of all service identifier keys to use in the\nservices\nsection, see\nUsing endpoints in the AWS CLI\n.\nThe service identifier key is followed by nested settings with each on its own line\nand indented by two spaces.\nThe following example configures the endpoint to use for requests made to the\nAmazon DynamoDB service in the\nmy-services\nsection that is used in the\ndev\nprofile. Any immediately\nfollowing lines that are indented are included in that subsection and apply to that\nservice.\n[profile\ndev\n]\nservices =\nmy-services\n[services\nmy-services\n]\ndynamodb =\nendpoint_url =\nhttp://localhost:8000\nFor more information on service-specific endpoints, see\nUsing endpoints in the AWS CLI\n.\nIf your profile has role-based credentials configured through a\nsource_profile\nparameter for IAM assume role functionality, the\nSDK only uses service configurations for the specified profile. It does not use\nprofiles that are role chained to it. For example, using the following\nshared\nconfig\nfile:\n[profile\nA\n]\ncredential_source =\nEc2InstanceMetadata\nendpoint_url =\nhttps://profile-a-endpoint.aws/\n[profile\nB\n]\nsource_profile =\nA\nrole_arn =\narn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/roleB\nservices =\nprofileB\n[services\nprofileB\n]\nec2 =\nendpoint_url =\nhttps://profile-b-ec2-endpoint.aws\nIf you use profile\nB\nand make a call in your code to Amazon EC2, the\nendpoint resolves as\nhttps://profile-b-ec2-endpoint.aws\n. If your code\nmakes a request to any other service, the endpoint resolution will not follow any\ncustom logic. The endpoint does not resolve to the global endpoint defined in\nprofile\nA\n. For a global endpoint to take effect for profile\nB\n, you would need to set\nendpoint_url\ndirectly within\nprofile\nB\n.\nWhere are configuration settings\nstored?\nThe AWS CLI stores sensitive credential information that you specify with\naws\nconfigure\nin a local file named\ncredentials\n, in a folder\nnamed\n.aws\nin your home directory. The less sensitive\nconfiguration options that you specify with\naws configure\nare stored in a\nlocal file named\nconfig\n, also stored in the\n.aws\nfolder in your home directory.\nStoring credentials in the config file\nYou can keep all of your profile settings in a single file as the AWS CLI can read\ncredentials from the\nconfig\nfile. If there are credentials in\nboth files for a profile sharing the same name, the keys in the credentials file\ntake precedence. We suggest keeping credentials in the\ncredentials\nfiles. These files are also used by the various language software development kits\n(SDKs). If you use one of the SDKs in addition to the AWS CLI, confirm if the\ncredentials should be stored in their own file.\nWhere you find your home directory location varies based on the operating system, but\nis referred to using the environment variables\n%UserProfile%\nin Windows and\n$HOME\nor\n~\n(tilde) in Unix-based systems. You can specify\na non-default location for the files by setting the\nAWS_CONFIG_FILE\nand\nAWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE\nenvironment variables to another local\npath. See\nConfiguring environment variables for the\nAWS CLI\nfor details.\nWhen you use a shared profile that specifies an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, the\nAWS CLI calls the AWS STS\nAssumeRole\noperation to retrieve temporary\ncredentials. These credentials are then stored (in\n~/.aws/cli/cache\n). Subsequent AWS CLI commands\nuse the cached temporary credentials until they expire, and at that point the AWS CLI\nautomatically refreshes the credentials.\nUsing named profiles\nIf no profile is explicitly defined, the\ndefault\nprofile is used.\nTo use a named profile, add the\n--profile\nprofile-name\noption to your command. The\nfollowing example lists all of your Amazon EC2 instances using the credentials and settings\ndefined in the\nuser1\nprofile.\n$\naws ec2 describe-instances --profile user1\nTo use a named profile for multiple commands, you can avoid specifying the profile in\nevery command by setting the\nAWS_PROFILE\nenvironment variable as the\ndefault profile. You can override this setting by using the\n--profile\nparameter.\nLinux or macOS\n$\nexport AWS_PROFILE=user1\nWindows\nC:\\>\nsetx AWS_PROFILE user1\nUsing\nset\nto set an environment variable changes the value\nused until the end of the current command prompt session, or until you set\nthe variable to a different value.\nUsing\nsetx\nto set an environment variable changes\nthe value in all command shells that you create after running the command.\nIt does\nnot\naffect any command shell that is already\nrunning at the time you run the command. Close and restart the command shell\nto see the effects of the change.\nSetting the environment variable changes the default profile until the end\nof your shell session, or until you set the variable to a different value.\nYou can make environment variables persistent across future sessions by\nputting them in your shell's startup script. For more information, see\nConfiguring environment variables for the\nAWS CLI\n.\nSet and view configuration settings using\ncommands\nThere are several ways to view and set your configuration settings using\ncommands.\naws\nconfigure\nRun this command to quickly set and view your credentials, Region, and\noutput format. The following example shows sample values.\n$\naws configure\nAWS Access Key ID [None]:\nAKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nAWS Secret Access Key [None]:\nwJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\nDefault region name [None]:\nus-west-2\nDefault output format [None]:\njson\naws configure\nset\nYou can set any credentials or configuration settings using\naws\nconfigure set\n. Specify the profile that you want to view or\nmodify with the\n--profile\nsetting.\nFor example, the following command sets the\nregion\nin the\nprofile named\ninteg\n.\n$\naws configure set region\nus-west-2\n--profile\ninteg\nTo remove a setting, manually delete the setting in your\nconfig\nand\ncredentials\nfiles\nin a text editor.\naws configure\nget\nYou can retrieve any credentials or configuration settings you've set\nusing\naws configure get\n. Specify the profile that you want to\nview or modify with the\n--profile\nsetting.\nFor example, the following command retrieves the\nregion\nsetting in the profile named\ninteg\n.\n$\naws configure get\nregion\n--profile\ninteg\nus-west-2\nIf the output is empty, the setting is not explicitly set and uses the\ndefault value.\naws configure\nimport\nImport\nCSV\ncredentials generated from the IAM web\nconsole. This is not for credentials generated from IAM Identity Center; customers who use\nIAM Identity Center should use aws configure sso. A CSV file is imported with the profile\nname matching the username. The CSV file must contain the following\nheaders.\nUser Name\nAccess key ID\nSecret access key\nNote\nDuring initial key pair creation, once you close the\nDownload .csv file\ndialog box, you cannot\naccess your secret access key after you close the dialog box. If you\nneed a\n.csv\nfile, you'll need to create one\nyourself with the required headers and your stored key pair information.\nIf you do not have access to your key pair information, you need to\ncreate a new key pair.\n$\naws configure import --csv\nfile://credentials.csv\naws configure\nlist\nTo list configuration data, use the\naws configure list\ncommand. This command lists the profile, access key, secret key, and region\nconfiguration information used for the specified profile. For each\nconfiguration item, it shows the value, where the configuration value was\nretrieved, and the configuration variable name.\nFor example, if you provide the AWS Region in an environment variable,\nthis command shows you the name of the region you've configured, that this\nvalue came from an environment variable, and the name of the environment\nvariable.\nFor temporary credential methods such as roles and IAM Identity Center, this command\ndisplays the temporarily cached access key and secret access key is\ndisplayed.\n$\naws configure list\nNAME       : VALUE                : TYPE                    : LOCATION\nprofile    : <not set>            : None                    : None\naccess_key : ****************ABCD : shared-credentials-file :\nsecret_key : ****************ABCD : shared-credentials-file :\nregion     : us-west-2            : env                     : AWS_DEFAULT_REGION\naws configure\nlist-profiles\nTo list all your profile names, use the\naws configure\nlist-profiles\ncommand.\n$\naws configure list-profiles\ndefault\ntest\naws configure\nmfa-login\nRun this command to configure a new profile to use with multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA) and your IAM user credentials in the specified\nprofile. If no profile is specified, the MFA is based on the\ndefault\nprofile.

For example, this value can be included in\noperational emails to uniquely identify which of your applications is\nassociated with the notification.\nThe Application ID is a string with maximum length of 50 characters.\nLetters, numbers and the following special characters are allowed:\n! $ % & * + - . , ^ _ ` | ~\nBy default, no value is\nassigned.\nsdk_ua_app_id =\nprod1\nThis setting can be overwritten by using the\nAWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID\nenvironment variable. You\ncan't set this value as a command line parameter.\nsigv4a_signing_region_set\nSpecifies the regions to use when signing with SigV4a using a\ncomma-delimited list. If this variable is not set, the AWS CLI uses the\ndefault used by the AWS service. If the AWS service has no default,\nthe request signature becomes valid in all regions using a value of\n*\n.\nsigv4a_signing_region_set =\nus-west-2, us-east-1\nFor more information on SigV4a, see\nAWS Signature\nVersion 4 for API requests\nin the\nIAM User Guide\nThis setting can be overwritten by using the\nAWS_SIGV4A_SIGNING_REGION_SET\nenvironment\nvariable. You can't set this value as a command line parameter.\nsource_profile\nSpecifies a named profile with long-term credentials that the AWS CLI\ncan use to assume a role that you specified with the\nrole_arn\nparameter. You cannot specify both\nsource_profile\nand\ncredential_source\nin\nthe same profile.\nsource_profile =\nproduction-profile\nsso_account_id\nSpecifies the AWS account ID that contains the IAM role with the\npermission that you want to grant to the associated IAM Identity Center user.\nThis setting does not have an environment variable or command line\noption.\nsso_account_id = 123456789012\nsso_region\nSpecifies the AWS Region that contains the AWS access portal host.\nThis is separate from, and can be a different Region than the default\nCLI\nregion\nparameter.\nThis setting does not have an environment variable or command line\noption.\nsso_region = us_west-2\nsso_registration_scopes\nA comma-delimited list of scopes to be authorized for the\nsso-session\n. Scopes authorize access to IAM Identity\nCenter bearer token authorized endpoints. A valid scope is a string,\nsuch as\nsso:account:access\n. This setting isn't applicable\nto the legacy non-refreshable configuration.\nsso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access\nsso_role_name\nSpecifies the friendly name of the IAM role that defines the user's\npermissions when using this profile.\nThis setting does not have an environment variable or command line\noption.\nsso_role_name = ReadAccess\nsso_start_url\nSpecifies the URL that points to the organization's AWS access\nportal. The AWS CLI uses this URL to establish a session with the IAM Identity Center\nservice to authenticate its users. To find your AWS access portal URL,\nuse one of the following:\nOpen your invitation email, the AWS access portal URL is\nlisted.\nOpen the AWS IAM Identity Center console at\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/\n. The AWS access\nportal URL is listed in your settings.\nThis setting does not have an environment variable or command line\noption.\nsso_start_url =\nhttps://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nuse_dualstack_endpoint\nEnables the use of dual-stack endpoints to send AWS requests. To\nlearn more about dual-stack endpoints, which support both IPv4 and IPv6\ntraffic, see\nUsing Amazon S3 dual-stack endpoints\nin the\nAmazon Simple Storage Service User Guide\n. Dual-stack endpoints\nare available for some services in some regions. If a dual-stack\nendpoint does not exist for the service or AWS Region, the request\nfails. Valid settings are\ntrue\nand\nfalse\n. This\nis disabled by default. For more information, see\nSet to use dual-stack endpoints for all\nAWS services\n.\nThis is mutually exclusive with the\nuse_accelerate_endpoint\nsetting.\nEndpoint precedence\nEndpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or\nuser environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on\nthe command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a\nparticular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the\nendpoint precedence list, see\nEndpoint configuration and settings\nprecedence\n.\nuse_fips_endpoint\nSome AWS services offer endpoints that support\nFederal Information\nProcessing Standard (FIPS) 140-2\nin some AWS Regions. When\nthe AWS service supports FIPS, this setting specifies what FIPS\nendpoint the AWS CLI should use . Unlike standard AWS endpoints, FIPS\nendpoints use a TLS software library that complies with FIPS 140-2.\nThese endpoints might be required by enterprises that interact with the\nUnited States government. For more information see,\nSet to use FIPs endpoints for all\nAWS services\n.\nIf this setting is enabled, but a FIPS endpoint does not exist for the\nservice in your AWS Region, the AWS command may fail. In this case,\nmanually specify the endpoint to use in the command using the\n--endpoint-url\noption or use\nservice-specific\nendpoints\n.\nEndpoint precedence\nEndpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or\nuser environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on\nthe command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a\nparticular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the\nendpoint precedence list, see\nEndpoint configuration and settings\nprecedence\n.\nweb_identity_token_file\nSpecifies the path to a file that contains an OAuth 2.0 access token\nor OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by an identity provider. The\nAWS CLI loads the contents of this file and passes it as the\nWebIdentityToken\nargument to the\nAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\noperation.\nThe environment variable\nAWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE\noverrides this\nsetting.\nFor more information on using web identities, see\nAssume role with web identity\n.\ntcp_keepalive\nSpecifies whether the AWS CLI client uses TCP keep-alive packets.\nThis entry does not have an equivalent environment variable or command\nline option.\ntcp_keepalive = false\nS3 Custom command settings\nAmazon S3 supports several settings that configure how the AWS CLI performs Amazon S3\noperations. Some apply to all S3 commands in both the\ns3api\nand\ns3\nnamespaces. Others are specifically for the S3 \"custom\" commands\nthat abstract common operations and do more than a one-to-one mapping to an API\noperation. The\naws s3\ntransfer commands\ncp\n,\nsync\n,\nmv\n, and\nrm\nhave additional settings\nyou can use to control S3 transfers.\nAll of these options can be configured by specifying the\ns3\nnested\nsetting in your\nconfig\nfile. Each setting is then indented on\nits own line.\nNote\nThese settings are entirely optional. You should be able to successfully use\nthe\naws s3\ntransfer commands without configuring any of these\nsettings. These settings are provided to enable you to tune for performance or\nto account for the specific environment where you are running these\naws\ns3\ncommands.\nThese settings are all set under a top-level\ns3\nkey in the\nconfig\nfile, as shown in the following example for the\ndevelopment\nprofile.\n[profile development]\ns3 =\nmax_concurrent_requests = 20\nmax_queue_size = 10000\nmultipart_threshold = 64MB\nmultipart_chunksize = 16MB\nmax_bandwidth = 50MB/s\nuse_accelerate_endpoint = true\naddressing_style = path\nThe following settings apply to any S3 command in the\ns3\nor\ns3api\nnamespaces.\naddressing_style\nSpecifies which addressing style to use. This controls whether the\nbucket name is in the hostname or is part of the URL. Valid values are:\npath\n,\nvirtual\n, and\nauto\n. The\ndefault value is\nauto\n.\nThere are two styles of constructing an Amazon S3 endpoint. The first is\ncalled\nvirtual\nand includes the bucket name as part of the\nhostname. For example:\nhttps://\nbucketname\n.s3.amazonaws.com\n.\nAlternatively, with the\npath\nstyle, you treat the bucket\nname as if it is a path in the URI; for example,\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/\nbucketname\n.\nThe default value in the CLI is to use\nauto\n, which attempts\nto use the\nvirtual\nstyle where it can, but will fall back\nto\npath\nstyle when required. For example, if your bucket\nname is not DNS compatible, the bucket name cannot be part of the\nhostname and must be in the path. With\nauto\n, the CLI will\ndetect this condition and automatically switch to\npath\nstyle for you. If you set the addressing style to\npath\n, you\nmust then ensure that the AWS Region you configured in the AWS CLI\nmatches the Region of your bucket.\npayload_signing_enabled\nSpecifies whether to SHA256 sign sigv4 payloads. By default, this is\ndisabled for streaming uploads (\nUploadPart\nand\nPutObject\n) when using HTTPS. By default, this is set to\nfalse\nfor streaming uploads (\nUploadPart\nand\nPutObject\n), but only if a\nContentMD5\nis\npresent (it is generated by default) and the endpoint uses HTTPS.\nIf set to true, S3 requests receive additional content validation in\nthe form of a SHA256 checksum which is calculated for you and included\nin the request signature. If set to false, the checksum isn't\ncalculated. Disabling this can be useful to reduce the performance\noverhead created by the checksum calculation.\nuse_accelerate_endpoint\nUse the Amazon S3 Accelerate endpoint for all\ns3\nand\ns3api\ncommands. The default value is false. This is\nmutually exclusive with the\nuse_dualstack_endpoint\nsetting.\nIf set to true, the AWS CLI directs all Amazon S3 requests to the\nS3\nAccelerate\nendpoint at\ns3-accelerate.amazonaws.com\n. To use this endpoint, you\nmust enable your bucket to use\nS3 Accelerate\n. All requests\nare sent using the virtual style of bucket addressing:\nmy-bucket\n.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com\n.\nAny\nListBuckets\n,\nCreateBucket\n, and\nDeleteBucket\nrequests aren't sent to the S3 Accelerate\nendpoint as that endpoint doesn't support those operations. This\nbehavior can also be set if the\n--endpoint-url\nparameter is\nset to\nhttps://s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com\nor\nhttp://s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com\nfor any\ns3\nor\ns3api\ncommand.\nuse_dualstack_endpoint\nEnables the use of dual-stack endpoints to send\ns3\nand\ns3api\nrequests. To learn more about dual-stack\nendpoints, which support both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, see\nUsing Amazon S3 dual-stack endpoints\nin the\nAmazon Simple Storage Service User Guide\n. Dual-stack endpoints\nare available for some services in some regions. If a dual-stack\nendpoint does not exist for the service or AWS Region, the request\nfails. Valid settings are\ntrue\nand\nfalse\n. This\nis disabled by default. For more information, see\nSet to use dual-stack endpoints for all\nAWS services\n.\nThis is mutually exclusive with the\nuse_accelerate_endpoint\nsetting.\nThe following settings apply only to commands in the\ns3\nnamespace\ncommand set.\nmax_bandwidth\nSpecifies the maximum bandwidth that can be consumed for uploading and\ndownloading data to and from Amazon S3. The default is no limit.\nThis limits the maximum bandwidth that the S3 commands can use to\ntransfer data to and from Amazon S3. This value applies to only uploads and\ndownloads; it doesn't apply to copies or deletes. The value is expressed\nas bytes per second. The value can be specified as:\nAn integer. For example,\n1048576\nsets the maximum\nbandwidth usage to 1 megabyte per second.\nAn integer followed by a rate suffix. You can specify rate\nsuffixes using:\nKB/s\n,\nMB/s\n, or\nGB/s\n. For example,\n300KB/s\n,\n10MB/s\n.\nIn general, we recommend that you first try to lower bandwidth\nconsumption by lowering\nmax_concurrent_requests\n. If that\ndoesn't adequately limit bandwidth consumption to the desired rate, you\ncan use the\nmax_bandwidth\nsetting to further limit\nbandwidth consumption. This is because\nmax_concurrent_requests\ncontrols how many threads are\ncurrently running. If you instead first lower\nmax_bandwidth\nbut leave a high\nmax_concurrent_requests\nsetting, it can\nresult in threads having to wait unnecessarily. This can lead to excess\nresource consumption and connection timeouts.\nmax_concurrent_requests\nSpecifies the maximum number of concurrent requests. The default value\nis 10.\nThe\naws s3\ntransfer commands are multithreaded. At any\ngiven time, multiple Amazon S3 requests can be running. For example, when you\nuse the command\naws s3 cp localdir s3://bucket/ --recursive\nto upload files to an S3 bucket, the AWS CLI can upload the files\nlocaldir/file1\n,\nlocaldir/file2\n, and\nlocaldir/file3\nin parallel. The setting\nmax_concurrent_requests\nspecifies the maximum number of\ntransfer operations that can run at the same time.\nYou might need to change this value for a few reasons:\nDecreasing this value â On some environments, the\ndefault of 10 concurrent requests can overwhelm a system. This\ncan cause connection timeouts or slow the responsiveness of the\nsystem. Lowering this value makes the S3 transfer commands less\nresource intensive. The tradeoff is that S3 transfers can take\nlonger to complete. Lowering this value might be necessary if\nyou use a tool to limit bandwidth.\nIncreasing this value â In some scenarios, you might\nwant the Amazon S3 transfers to complete as quickly as possible,\nusing as much network bandwidth as necessary. In this scenario,\nthe default number of concurrent requests might not be\nsufficient to use all of the available network bandwidth.\nIncreasing this value can improve the time it takes to complete\nan Amazon S3 transfer.\nmax_queue_size\nSpecifies the maximum number of tasks in the task queue. The default\nvalue is 1000.\nThe AWS CLI internally uses a model where it queues up Amazon S3 tasks that\nare then executed by consumers whose numbers are limited by\nmax_concurrent_requests\n. A task generally maps to a\nsingle Amazon S3 operation. For example, a task could be a\nPutObjectTask\n, or a\nGetObjectTask\n, or an\nUploadPartTask\n. The rate at which tasks are added to\nthe queue can be much faster than the rate at which consumers finish the\ntasks. To avoid unbounded growth, the task queue size is capped to a\nspecific size. This setting changes the value of that maximum\nnumber.\nYou generally don't need to change this setting. This setting also\ncorresponds to the number of tasks that the AWS CLI is aware of that need\nto be run. This means that by default the AWS CLI can only see 1000 tasks\nahead. Increasing this value means that the AWS CLI can more quickly know\nthe total number of tasks needed, assuming that the queuing rate is\nquicker than the rate of task completion. The tradeoff is that a larger\nmax_queue_size requires more memory.\nmultipart_chunksize\nSpecifies the chunk size that the AWS CLI uses for multipart transfers\nof individual files. The default value is 8 MB, with a minimum of 5\nMB.\nWhen a file transfer exceeds the\nmultipart_threshold\n, the\nAWS CLI divides the file into chunks of this size. This value can be\nspecified using the same syntax as\nmultipart_threshold\n,\neither as the number of bytes as an integer, or by using a size and a\nsuffix.\nmultipart_threshold\nSpecifies the size threshold the AWS CLI uses for multipart transfers of\nindividual files. The default value is 8 MB.\nWhen uploading, downloading, or copying a file, the Amazon S3 commands\nswitch to multipart operations if the file exceeds this size. You can\nspecify this value in one of two ways:\nThe file size in bytes. For example,\n1048576\n.\nThe file size with a size suffix. You can use\nKB\n,\nMB\n,\nGB\n, or\nTB\n. For\nexample:\n10MB\n,\n1GB\n.\nNote\nS3 can impose constraints on valid values that can be used\nfor multipart operations.

See the\nUser Guide\nfor\nhelp getting started.\n[\naws\n]\ns3\nÂ¶\nDescription\nÂ¶\nThis section explains prominent concepts and notations in the set of high-level S3 commands provided.\nIf you are looking for the low level S3 commands for the CLI, please see the\ns3api\ncommand\nreference page\n.\nPath Argument Type\nÂ¶\nWhenever using a command, at least one path argument must be specified.  There\nare two types of path arguments:\nLocalPath\nand\nS3Uri\n.\nLocalPath\n: represents the path of a local file or directory.  It can be\nwritten as an absolute path or relative path.\nS3Uri\n: represents the location of a S3 object, prefix, or bucket.  This\nmust be written in the form\ns3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/mykey\nwhere\namzn-s3-demo-bucket\nis\nthe specified S3 bucket,\nmykey\nis the specified S3 key.  The path argument\nmust begin with\ns3://\nin order to denote that the path argument refers to\na S3 object. Note that prefixes are separated by forward slashes. For\nexample, if the S3 object\nmyobject\nhad the prefix\nmyprefix\n, the\nS3 key would be\nmyprefix/myobject\n, and if the object was in the bucket\namzn-s3-demo-bucket\n, the\nS3Uri\nwould be\ns3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myprefix/myobject\n.\nS3Uri\nalso supports S3 access points. To specify an access point, this\nvalue must be of the form\ns3://<access-point-arn>/<key>\n. For example if\nthe access point\nmyaccesspoint\nto be used has the ARN:\narn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint\nand the object\nbeing accessed has the key\nmykey\n, then the\nS3URI\nused must be:\ns3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey\n.\nSimilar to bucket names, you can also use prefixes with access point ARNs for\nthe\nS3Uri\n. For example:\ns3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/myprefix/\nOrder of Path Arguments\nÂ¶\nEvery command takes one or two positional path arguments.  The first path\nargument represents the source, which is the local file/directory or S3\nobject/prefix/bucket that is being referenced.  If there is a second path\nargument, it represents the destination, which is the local file/directory\nor S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being operated on.  Commands with only\none path argument do not have a destination because the operation is being\nperformed only on the source.\nSingle Local File and S3 Object Operations\nÂ¶\nSome commands perform operations only on single files and S3 objects.  The\nfollowing commands are single file/object operations if no\n--recursive\nflag is provided.\ncp\nmv\nrm\nFor this type of operation, the first path argument, the source, must exist\nand be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument, the destination,\ncan be the name of a local file, local directory, S3 object, S3 prefix,\nor S3 bucket.\nThe destination is indicated as a local directory, S3 prefix, or S3 bucket\nif it ends with a forward slash or back slash.  The use of slash depends\non the path argument type.  If the path argument is a\nLocalPath\n,\nthe type of slash is the separator used by the operating system.  If the\npath is a\nS3Uri\n, the forward slash must always be used.  If a slash\nis at the end of the destination, the destination file or object will\nadopt the name of the source file or object.  Otherwise, if there is no\nslash at the end, the file or object will be saved under the name provided.\nSee examples in\ncp\nand\nmv\nto illustrate this description.\nDirectory and S3 Prefix Operations\nÂ¶\nSome commands only perform operations on the contents of a local directory\nor S3 prefix/bucket.  Adding or omitting a forward slash or back slash to\nthe end of any path argument, depending on its type, does not affect the\nresults of the operation.  The following commands will always result in\na directory or S3 prefix/bucket operation:\nsync\nmb\nrb\nls\nUse of Exclude and Include Filters\nÂ¶\nCurrently, there is no support for the use of UNIX style wildcards in\na commandâs path arguments.  However, most commands have\n--exclude\n\"<value>\"\nand\n--include\n\"<value>\"\nparameters that can achieve the desired result.\nThese parameters perform pattern matching to either exclude or include\na particular file or object.  The following pattern symbols are supported.\n*\n: Matches everything\n?\n: Matches any single character\n[sequence]\n: Matches any character in\nsequence\n[!sequence]\n: Matches any character not in\nsequence\nAny number of these parameters can be passed to a command.  You can do this by\nproviding an\n--exclude\nor\n--include\nargument multiple times, e.g.\n--include\n\"*.txt\"\n--include\n\"*.png\"\n.\nWhen there are multiple filters, the rule is the filters that appear later in\nthe command take precedence over filters that appear earlier in the command.\nFor example, if the filter parameters passed to the command were\n--\nexclude\n\"*\"\n--\ninclude\n\"*.txt\"\nAll files will be excluded from the command except for files ending with\n.txt\nHowever, if the order of the filter parameters was changed to\n--\ninclude\n\"*.txt\"\n--\nexclude\n\"*\"\nAll files will be excluded from the command.\nEach filter is evaluated against the\nsource directory\n.  If the source\nlocation is a file instead of a directory, the directory containing the file is\nused as the source directory.  For example, suppose you had the following\ndirectory structure:\n/\ntmp\n/\nfoo\n/\n.\ngit\n/\n|---\nconfig\n|---\ndescription\nfoo\n.\ntxt\nbar\n.\ntxt\nbaz\n.\njpg\nIn the command\naws\ns3\nsync\n/tmp/foo\ns3://bucket/\nthe source directory is\n/tmp/foo\n.  Any include/exclude filters will be evaluated with the source\ndirectory prepended.

See the\nUser Guide\nfor\nhelp getting started.\n[\naws\n]\nlambda\nÂ¶\nDescription\nÂ¶\nOverview\nLambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see\nWhat is Lambda\nin the\nLambda Developer Guide\n.\nThe\nLambda API Reference\nprovides information about each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and response.\nYou can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see\nTools for Amazon Web Services\n.\nFor a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see\nLambda endpoints and quotas\nin the\nAmazon Web Services General Reference.\n.\nWhen making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information, see\nSignature Version 4 signing process\nin the\nAmazon Web Services General Reference.\n.\nCA certificates\nBecause Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computerâs CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:\nMicrosoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.\nMac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.\nJava 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.\nWhen accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs:\nAmazon Root CA 1\nStarfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2\nStarfield Class 2 Certification Authority\nRoot certificates from the first two authorities are available from\nAmazon trust services\n, but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see\nAmazon Web Services Certificate Manager FAQs.\nAvailable Commands\nÂ¶\nadd-layer-version-permission\nadd-permission\ncreate-alias\ncreate-code-signing-config\ncreate-event-source-mapping\ncreate-function\ncreate-function-url-config\ndelete-alias\ndelete-code-signing-config\ndelete-event-source-mapping\ndelete-function\ndelete-function-code-signing-config\ndelete-function-concurrency\ndelete-function-event-invoke-config\ndelete-function-url-config\ndelete-layer-version\ndelete-provisioned-concurrency-config\nget-account-settings\nget-alias\nget-code-signing-config\nget-event-source-mapping\nget-function\nget-function-code-signing-config\nget-function-concurrency\nget-function-configuration\nget-function-event-invoke-config\nget-function-recursion-config\nget-function-url-config\nget-layer-version\nget-layer-version-by-arn\nget-layer-version-policy\nget-policy\nget-provisioned-concurrency-config\nget-runtime-management-config\ninvoke\nlist-aliases\nlist-code-signing-configs\nlist-event-source-mappings\nlist-function-event-invoke-configs\nlist-function-url-configs\nlist-functions\nlist-functions-by-code-signing-config\nlist-layer-versions\nlist-layers\nlist-provisioned-concurrency-configs\nlist-tags\nlist-versions-by-function\npublish-layer-version\npublish-version\nput-function-code-signing-config\nput-function-concurrency\nput-function-event-invoke-config\nput-function-recursion-config\nput-provisioned-concurrency-config\nput-runtime-management-config\nremove-layer-version-permission\nremove-permission\ntag-resource\nuntag-resource\nupdate-alias\nupdate-code-signing-config\nupdate-event-source-mapping\nupdate-function-code\nupdate-function-configuration\nupdate-function-event-invoke-config\nupdate-function-url-config\nwait\nwizard\n← update-table-storage-optimizer\n/\nadd-layer-version-permission →\nNavigation\nindex\nnext\n|\nprevious\n|\nAWS CLI 2.32.3 Command Reference\n»\naws\n»\nlambda\n© Copyright 2025, Amazon Web Services.

It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.\nAmazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instanceâs compute resources and storage capacity to meet your applicationâs demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.\nThis interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.\nAmazon RDS API Reference\nFor the alphabetical list of API actions, see\nAPI Actions\n.\nFor the

It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure thatâs managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you manage.\nAmazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.\nYou can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you donât need to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems. You also donât need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure.\nAvailable Commands\nÂ¶\ncreate-capacity-provider\ncreate-cluster\ncreate-express-gateway-service\ncreate-service\ncreate-task-set\ndelete-account-setting\ndelete-attributes\ndelete-capacity-provider\ndelete-cluster\ndelete-express-gateway-service\ndelete-service\ndelete-task-definitions\ndelete-task-set\ndeploy\nderegister-container-instance\nderegister-task-definition\ndescribe-capacity-providers\ndescribe-clusters\ndescribe-container-instances\ndescribe-express-gateway-service\ndescribe-service-deployments\ndescribe-service-revisions\ndescribe-services\ndescribe-task-definition\ndescribe-task-sets\ndescribe-tasks\ndiscover-poll-endpoint\nexecute-command\nget-task-protection\nlist-account-settings\nlist-attributes\nlist-clusters\nlist-container-instances\nlist-service-deployments\nlist-services\nlist-services-by-namespace\nlist-tags-for-resource\nlist-task-definition-families\nlist-task-definitions\nlist-tasks\nmonitor-express-gateway-service\nput-account-setting\nput-account-setting-default\nput-attributes\nput-cluster-capacity-providers\nregister-container-instance\nregister-task-definition\nrun-task\nstart-task\nstop-service-deployment\nstop-task\nsubmit-attachment-state-changes\nsubmit-container-state-change\nsubmit-task-state-change\ntag-resource\nuntag-resource\nupdate-capacity-provider\nupdate-cluster\nupdate-cluster-settings\nupdate-container-agent\nupdate-container-instances-state\nupdate-express-gateway-service\nupdate-service\nupdate-service-primary-task-set\nupdate-task-protection\nupdate-task-set\nwait\n← upload-layer-part\n/\ncreate-capacity-provider →\nNavigation\nindex\nnext\n|\nprevious\n|\nAWS CLI 2.32.3 Command Reference\n»\naws\n»\necs\n© Copyright 2025, Amazon Web Services.
