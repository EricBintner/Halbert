{"text": "Challenge Types -  Let's Encrypt\nLanguages\nEnglish\nCatalà\nČeština\nDansk\nDeutsch\nGreek\nEspañol\nSuomi\nFrançais\nעברית\nHungarian\nBahasa Indonesia\nItaliano\n日本語\n한국어\nPolish\nPortuguês do Brasil\nРусский\nසිංහල\nSrpski\nSvenska\nTamil\nThai\nTürkçe\nУкраїнська\nTiếng Việt\n简体中文\n繁體中文\nSkip navigation links\nDonate Now\nChallenge Types\nLast updated: January 7, 2025\nSee all Documentation\nWhen you get a certificate from Let’s Encrypt, our servers validate that\nyou control the domain names in that certificate using “challenges,”\nas defined by the ACME standard. Most of the time, this validation\nis handled automatically by your ACME client, but if you need to make\nsome more complex configuration decisions, it’s useful to know more\nabout them. If you’re unsure, go with your client’s defaults or\nwith HTTP-01.\nHTTP-01 challenge\nThis is the most common challenge type today. Let’s Encrypt gives a\ntoken to your ACME client, and your ACME client puts a file on your web\nserver at\nhttp://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<TOKEN>\n. That\nfile contains the token, plus a thumbprint of your account key. Once\nyour ACME client tells Let’s Encrypt that the file is ready, Let’s\nEncrypt tries retrieving it (potentially multiple times from multiple vantage\npoints). If our validation checks get the right\nresponses from your web server, the validation is considered successful\nand you can go on to issue your certificate. If the validation checks fail,\nyou’ll have to try again with a new certificate.\nOur implementation of the HTTP-01 challenge follows redirects, up to 10\nredirects deep. It only accepts redirects to “http:” or “https:”,\nand only to ports 80 or 443. It does not accept redirects to IP addresses. When\nredirected to an HTTPS URL, it does not validate certificates (since this\nchallenge is intended to bootstrap valid certificates, it may encounter\nself-signed or expired certificates along the way).\nThe HTTP-01 challenge can only be done on port 80. Allowing clients to\nspecify arbitrary ports would make the challenge less secure, and so it\nis not allowed by the ACME standard.\nPros:\nIt’s easy to automate without extra knowledge about a domain’s configuration.\nIt allows hosting providers to issue certificates for domains CNAMEd to them.\nIt works with off-the-shelf web servers.\nIt can be used to validate IP Addresses as well.\nCons:\nIt doesn’t work if your ISP blocks port 80 (this is rare, but some residential ISPs do this).\nLet’s Encrypt doesn’t let you use this challenge to issue wildcard certificates.\nIf you have multiple web servers, you have to make sure the file is available on all of them.\nDNS-01 challenge\nThis challenge asks you to prove that you control the DNS for your\ndomain name by putting a specific value in a TXT record under that domain\nname. It is harder to configure than HTTP-01, but can work in scenarios\nthat HTTP-01 can’t. It also allows you to issue wildcard certificates.\nAfter Let’s Encrypt gives your ACME client a token, your client\nwill create a TXT record derived from that token and your account key,\nand put that record at\n_acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN>\n. Then Let’s\nEncrypt will query the DNS system for that record. If it finds a match,\nyou can proceed to issue a certificate!\nSince automation of issuance and renewals is really important, it only\nmakes sense to use DNS-01 challenges if your DNS provider has an API you\ncan use to automate updates. Our community has started a\nlist of such DNS\nproviders here\n. Your DNS provider may be the same as\nyour registrar (the company you bought your domain name from), or it\nmight be different. If you want to change your DNS provider, you just\nneed to make some small changes at your registrar. You don’t need to\nwait for your domain to be close to expiration to do so.\nNote that putting your full DNS API credentials on your web server\nsignificantly increases the impact if that web server is hacked. Best\npractice is to use\nmore narrowly scoped API\ncredentials\n, or perform DNS\nvalidation from a separate server and automatically copy certificates\nto your web server.\nSince Let’s Encrypt follows the DNS standards when looking up TXT\nrecords for DNS-01 validation, you can use CNAME records or NS records to\ndelegate answering the challenge to other DNS zones. This can be used to\ndelegate the\n_acme-challenge\nsubdomain\nto a validation-specific server or zone. It can also be used if your DNS\nprovider is slow to update, and you want to delegate to a quicker-updating\nserver.\nMost DNS providers have a “propagation time” that governs how long it\ntakes from the time you update a DNS record until it’s available on all\nof their servers. It can be hard to measure this because they often also\nuse\nanycast\n, which means multiple servers can have the same IP address,\nand depending on where you are in the world you might talk to a different\nserver (and get a different answer) than Let’s Encrypt does. The best\nDNS APIs provide a way for you to automatically check whether an update\nis fully propagated. If your DNS provider doesn’t have this, you just\nhave to configure your client to wait long enough (often as much as an\nhour) to ensure the update is propagated before triggering validation.\nYou can have multiple TXT records in place for the same name. For\ninstance, this might happen if you are validating a challenge for a\nwildcard and a non-wildcard certificate at the same time. However, you\nshould make sure to clean up old TXT records, because if the response\nsize gets too big Let’s Encrypt will start rejecting it.\nPros:\nYou can use this challenge to issue certificates containing wildcard domain names.\nIt works well even if you have multiple web servers.\nYou can use this challenge to domain names whose webservers aren’t exposed to the public internet.\nCons:\nKeeping API credentials on your web server is risky.\nYour DNS provider might not offer an API.\nYour DNS API may not provide information on propagation times.\nIt cannot be used to validate IP Addresses.\nTLS-ALPN-01\nThis challenge was developed after TLS-SNI-01 became deprecated, and is\nbeing developed as\na separate standard\n. Like TLS-SNI-01, it is performed\nvia TLS on port 443. However, it uses a custom ALPN protocol to ensure\nthat only servers that are aware of this challenge type will respond\nto validation requests. This also allows validation requests for this\nchallenge type to use an SNI field that matches the domain name being\nvalidated, making it more secure.\nThis challenge is not suitable for most people. It is best suited\nto authors of TLS-terminating reverse proxies that want to perform\nhost-based validation like HTTP-01, but want to do it entirely at the\nTLS layer in order to separate concerns. Right now that mainly means\nlarge hosting providers.\nPros:\nIt works if port 80 is unavailable to you.\nIt can be performed purely at the TLS layer.\nIt can be used to validate IP Addresses as well.\nCons:\nACME client support is limited.\nLike HTTP-01, if you have multiple servers they need to all answer with the same content.\nThis method cannot be used to validate wildcard domains.\nTLS-SNI-01\nThis challenge was defined in draft versions of ACME. It did a TLS\nhandshake on port 443 and sent a specific\nSNI\nheader, looking for\ncertificate that contained the token. It\nwas removed in March\n2019\nbecause it was not secure enough.\n© 2025\nInternet Security Research Group\nGitHub\nLinkedIn\nTerms\nPrivacy Policy\nTrademark Policy", "metadata": {"source_type": "vendor_docs", "trust": "vendor_docs", "os": "linux", "distro": "ubuntu-22.04", "license": "CC BY-SA (assumed; verify per site)", "attribution_url": "https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/"}}
{"text": "openssl - OpenSSL Documentation\nSkip to content\nopenssl\n¶\nNAME\n¶\nopenssl - OpenSSL command line program\nSYNOPSIS\n¶\nopenssl\ncommand\n[\noptions\n... ] [\nparameters\n... ]\nopenssl\nno-\nXXX\n[\noptions\n]\nDESCRIPTION\n¶\nOpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and related cryptography standards required by them.\nThe\nopenssl\nprogram is a command line program for using the various cryptography functions of OpenSSL's\ncrypto\nlibrary from the shell. It can be used for\no  Creation and management of private keys, public keys and parameters\no  Public key cryptographic operations\no  Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs\no  Calculation of Message Digests and Message Authentication Codes\no  Encryption and Decryption with Ciphers\no  SSL/TLS Client and Server Tests\no  Handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail\no  Timestamp requests, generation and verification\nCOMMAND SUMMARY\n¶\nThe\nopenssl\nprogram provides a rich variety of commands (\ncommand\nin the\n\"SYNOPSIS\"\nabove). Each command can have many options and argument parameters, shown above as\noptions\nand\nparameters\n.\nDetailed documentation and use cases for most standard subcommands are available (e.g.,\nopenssl-x509(1)\n). The subcommand\nopenssl-list(1)\nmay be used to list subcommands.\nThe command\nno-\nXXX\ntests whether a command of the specified name is available. If no command named\nXXX\nexists, it returns 0 (success) and prints\nno-\nXXX\n; otherwise it returns 1 and prints\nXXX\n. In both cases, the output goes to\nstdout\nand nothing is printed to\nstderr\n. Additional command line arguments are always ignored. Since for each cipher there is a command of the same name, this provides an easy way for shell scripts to test for the availability of ciphers in the\nopenssl\nprogram. (\nno-\nXXX\nis not able to detect pseudo-commands such as\nquit\n,\nlist\n, or\nno-\nXXX\nitself.)\nConfiguration Option\n¶\nMany commands use an external configuration file for some or all of their arguments and have a\n-config\noption to specify that file. The default name of the file is\nopenssl.cnf\nin the default certificate storage area, which can be determined from the\nopenssl-version(1)\ncommand using the\n-d\nor\n-a\noption. The environment variable\nOPENSSL_CONF\ncan be used to specify a different file location or to disable loading a configuration (using the empty string).\nAmong others, the configuration file can be used to load modules and to specify parameters for generating certificates and random numbers.

This section describes some common options with common behavior.\nCommon Options\n¶\n-help\nProvides a terse summary of all options. If an option takes an argument, the \"type\" of argument is also given.\n--\nThis terminates the list of options. It is mostly useful if any filename parameters start with a minus sign:\nopenssl verify [flags...] -- -cert1.pem...\nFormat Options\n¶\nSee\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor manual page.\nPass Phrase Options\n¶\nSee the\nopenssl-passphrase-options(1)\nmanual page.\nRandom State Options\n¶\nPrior to OpenSSL 1.1.1, it was common for applications to store information about the state of the random-number generator in a file that was loaded at startup and rewritten upon exit. On modern operating systems, this is generally no longer necessary as OpenSSL will seed itself from a trusted entropy source provided by the operating system. These flags are still supported for special platforms or circumstances that might require them.\nIt is generally an error to use the same seed file more than once and every use of\n-rand\nshould be paired with\n-writerand\n.\n-rand\nfiles\nA file or files containing random data used to seed the random number generator. Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character. The separator is\n;\nfor MS-Windows,\n,\nfor OpenVMS, and\n:\nfor all others. Another way to specify multiple files is to repeat this flag with different filenames.\n-writerand\nfile\nWrites the seed data to the specified\nfile\nupon exit. This file can be used in a subsequent command invocation.\nCertificate Verification Options\n¶\nSee the\nopenssl-verification-options(1)\nmanual page.\nName Format Options\n¶\nSee the\nopenssl-namedisplay-options(1)\nmanual page.\nTLS Version Options\n¶\nSeveral commands use SSL, TLS, or DTLS. By default, the commands use TLS and clients will offer the lowest and highest protocol version they support, and servers will pick the highest version that the client offers that is also supported by the server.\nThe options below can be used to limit which protocol versions are used, and whether TCP (SSL and TLS) or UDP (DTLS) is used. Note that not all protocols and flags may be available, depending on how OpenSSL was built.\n-ssl3\n,\n-tls1\n,\n-tls1_1\n,\n-tls1_2\n,\n-tls1_3\n,\n-no_ssl3\n,\n-no_tls1\n,\n-no_tls1_1\n,\n-no_tls1_2\n,\n-no_tls1_3\nThese options require or disable the use of the specified SSL or TLS protocols. When a specific TLS version is required, only that version will be offered or accepted. Only one specific protocol can be given and it cannot be combined with any of the\nno_\noptions. The\nno_*\noptions do not work with\ns_time\nand\nciphers\ncommands but work with\ns_client\nand\ns_server\ncommands.\n-dtls\n,\n-dtls1\n,\n-dtls1_2\nThese options specify to use DTLS instead of TLS. With\n-dtls\n, clients will negotiate any supported DTLS protocol version. Use the\n-dtls1\nor\n-dtls1_2\noptions to support only DTLS1.0 or DTLS1.2, respectively.\nEngine Options\n¶\n-engine\nid\nLoad the engine identified by\nid\nand use all the methods it implements (algorithms, key storage, etc.), unless specified otherwise in the command-specific documentation or it is configured to do so, as described in\n\"Engine Configuration\" in config(5)\n.\nThe engine will be used for key ids specified with\n-key\nand similar options when an option like\n-keyform engine\nis given.\nA special case is the\nloader_attic\nengine, which is meant just for internal OpenSSL testing purposes and supports loading keys, parameters, certificates, and CRLs from files. When this engine is used, files with such credentials are read via this engine. Using the\nfile:\nschema is optional; a plain file (path) name will do.\nOptions specifying keys, like\n-key\nand similar, can use the generic OpenSSL engine key loading URI scheme\norg.openssl.engine:\nto retrieve private keys and public keys. The URI syntax is as follows, in simplified form:\norg.openssl.engine:{engineid}:{keyid}\nWhere\n{engineid}\nis the identity/name of the engine, and\n{keyid}\nis a key identifier that's acceptable by that engine. For example, when using an engine that interfaces against a PKCS#11 implementation, the generic key URI would be something like this (this happens to be an example for the PKCS#11 engine that's part of OpenSC):\n-key org.openssl.engine:pkcs11:label_some-private-key\nAs a third possibility, for engines and providers that have implemented their own\nOSSL_STORE_LOADER(3)\n,\norg.openssl.engine:\nshould not be necessary. For a PKCS#11 implementation that has implemented such a loader, the PKCS#11 URI as defined in RFC 7512 should be possible to use directly:\n-key pkcs11:object=some-private-key;pin-value=1234\nProvider Options\n¶\n-provider\nname\nLoad and initialize the provider identified by\nname\n. The\nname\ncan be also a path to the provider module. In that case the provider name will be the specified path and not just the provider module name. Interpretation of relative paths is platform specific. The configured \"MODULESDIR\" path,\nOPENSSL_MODULES\nenvironment variable, or the path specified by\n-provider-path\nis prepended to relative paths.

It can additionally create self-signed certificates for use as root CAs for example.\nOPTIONS\n¶\n-help\nPrint out a usage message.\n-inform\nDER\n|\nPEM\n,\n-outform\nDER\n|\nPEM\nThe input and output formats; unspecified by default. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\nThe data is a PKCS#10 object.\n-in\nfilename\nThis specifies the input filename to read a request from. This defaults to standard input unless\n-x509\nor\n-CA\nis specified. A request is only read if the creation options (\n-new\nor\n-newkey\nor\n-precert\n) are not specified.\n-sigopt\nnm\n:\nv\nPass options to the signature algorithm during sign operations. Names and values of these options are algorithm-specific.\n-vfyopt\nnm\n:\nv\nPass options to the signature algorithm during verify operations. Names and values of these options are algorithm-specific.\n-passin\narg\nThe password source for private key and certificate input. For more information about the format of\narg\nsee\nopenssl-passphrase-options(1)\n.\n-passout\narg\nThe password source for the output file. For more information about the format of\narg\nsee\nopenssl-passphrase-options(1)\n.\n-out\nfilename\nThis specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by default.\n-text\nPrints out the certificate request in text form.\n-subject\nPrints out the certificate request subject (or certificate subject if\n-x509\nis in use).\n-pubkey\nPrints out the public key.\n-noout\nThis option prevents output of the encoded version of the certificate request.\n-modulus\nPrints out the value of the modulus of the public key contained in the request.\n-verify\nVerifies the self-signature on the request.\n-new\nThis option generates a new certificate request. It will prompt the user for the relevant field values. The actual fields prompted for and their maximum and minimum sizes are specified in the configuration file and any requested extensions.\nIf the\n-key\noption is not given it will generate a new private key using information specified in the configuration file or given with the\n-newkey\nand\n-pkeyopt\noptions, else by default an RSA key with 2048 bits length.\n-newkey\narg\nThis option is used to generate a new private key unless\n-key\nis given. It is subsequently used as if it was given using the\n-key\noption.\nThis option implies the\n-new\nflag to create a new certificate request or a new certificate in case\n-x509\nis given.\nThe argument takes one of several forms.\n[\nrsa:\n]\nnbits\ngenerates an RSA key\nnbits\nin size. If\nnbits\nis omitted, i.e.,\n-newkey\nrsa\nis specified, the default key size specified in the configuration file with the\ndefault_bits\noption is used if present, else 2048.\nAll other algorithms support the\n-newkey\nalgname\n:\nfile\nform, where\nfile\nis an algorithm parameter file, created with\nopenssl genpkey -genparam\nor an X.509 certificate for a key with appropriate algorithm.\nparam:\nfile\ngenerates a key using the parameter file or certificate\nfile\n, the algorithm is determined by the parameters.\nalgname\n[:\nfile\n] generates a key using the given algorithm\nalgname\n. If a parameter file\nfile\nis given then the parameters specified there are used, where the algorithm parameters must match\nalgname\n. If algorithm parameters are not given, any necessary parameters should be specified via the\n-pkeyopt\noption.\ndsa:\nfilename\ngenerates a DSA key using the parameters in the file\nfilename\n.\nec:\nfilename\ngenerates EC key (usable both with ECDSA or ECDH algorithms),\ngost2001:\nfilename\ngenerates GOST R 34.10-2001 key (requires\ngost\nengine configured in the configuration file). If just\ngost2001\nis specified a parameter set should be specified by\n-pkeyopt\nparamset:X\n-pkeyopt\nopt\n:\nvalue\nSet the public key algorithm option\nopt\nto\nvalue\n. The precise set of options supported depends on the public key algorithm used and its implementation. See\n\"KEY GENERATION OPTIONS\" in openssl-genpkey(1)\nfor more details.\n-key\nfilename\n|\nuri\nThis option provides the private key for signing a new certificate or certificate request. Unless\n-in\nis given, the corresponding public key is placed in the new certificate or certificate request, resulting in a self-signature.\nFor certificate signing this option is overridden by the\n-CA\noption.\nThis option also accepts PKCS#8 format private keys for PEM format files.\n-keyform\nDER\n|\nPEM\n|\nP12\n|\nENGINE\nThe format of the private key; unspecified by default. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\n-keyout\nfilename\nThis gives the filename to write any private key to that has been newly created or read from\n-key\n. If neither the\n-keyout\noption nor the\n-key\noption are given then the filename specified in the configuration file with the\ndefault_keyfile\noption is used, if present. Thus, if you want to write the private key and the\n-key\noption is provided, you should provide the\n-keyout\noption explicitly. If a new key is generated and no filename is specified the key is written to standard output.\n-noenc\nIf this option is specified then if a private key is created it will not be encrypted.\n-nodes\nThis option is deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0; use\n-noenc\ninstead.\n-\ndigest\nThis specifies the message digest to sign the request. Any digest supported by the OpenSSL\ndgst\ncommand can be used. This overrides the digest algorithm specified in the configuration file.\nSome public key algorithms may override this choice. For instance, DSA signatures always use SHA1, GOST R 34.10 signatures always use GOST R 34.11-94 (\n-md_gost94\n), Ed25519 and Ed448 never use any digest.\n-config\nfilename\nThis allows an alternative configuration file to be specified. Optional; for a description of the default value, see\n\"COMMAND SUMMARY\" in openssl(1)\n.\n-section\nname\nSpecifies the name of the section to use; the default is\nreq\n.\n-subj\narg\nSets subject name for new request or supersedes the subject name when processing a certificate request.\nThe arg must be formatted as\n/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...\n. Special characters may be escaped by\n\\\n(backslash), whitespace is retained. Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included in the request. Giving a single\n/\nwill lead to an empty sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN). Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a\n+\ncharacter instead of a\n/\nbetween the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the set. Example:\n/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe\n-multivalue-rdn\nThis option has been deprecated and has no effect.\n-x509\nThis option outputs a certificate instead of a certificate request. This is typically used to generate test certificates. It is implied by the\n-CA\noption.\nThis option implies the\n-new\nflag if\n-in\nis not given.\nIf an existing request is specified with the\n-in\noption, it is converted to a certificate; otherwise a request is created from scratch.\nUnless specified using the\n-set_serial\noption, a large random number will be used for the serial number.\nUnless the\n-copy_extensions\noption is used, X.509 extensions are not copied from any provided request input file.\nX.509 extensions to be added can be specified in the configuration file or using the\n-addext\noption.\n-CA\nfilename\n|\nuri\nSpecifies the \"CA\" certificate to be used for signing a new certificate and implies use of\n-x509\n. When present, this behaves like a \"micro CA\" as follows: The subject name of the \"CA\" certificate is placed as issuer name in the new certificate, which is then signed using the \"CA\" key given as specified below.\n-CAkey\nfilename\n|\nuri\nSets the \"CA\" private key to sign a certificate with. The private key must match the public key of the certificate given with\n-CA\n. If this option is not provided then the key must be present in the\n-CA\ninput.\n-days\nn\nWhen\n-x509\nis in use this specifies the number of days to certify the certificate for, otherwise it is ignored.\nn\nshould be a positive integer. The default is 30 days.\n-set_serial\nn\nSerial number to use when outputting a self-signed certificate. This may be specified as a decimal value or a hex value if preceded by\n0x\n. If not given, a large random number will be used.\n-copy_extensions\narg\nDetermines how X.509 extensions in certificate requests should be handled when\n-x509\nis in use. If\narg\nis\nnone\nor this option is not present then extensions are ignored. If\narg\nis\ncopy\nor\ncopyall\nthen all extensions in the request are copied to the certificate.\nThe main use of this option is to allow a certificate request to supply values for certain extensions such as subjectAltName.\n-addext\next\nAdd a specific extension to the certificate (if\n-x509\nis in use) or certificate request. The argument must have the form of a key=value pair as it would appear in a config file.\nThis option can be given multiple times.\n-extensions\nsection\n-reqexts\nsection\nThese options specify alternative sections to include certificate extensions (if\n-x509\nis in use) or certificate request extensions. This allows several different sections to be used in the same configuration file to specify requests for a variety of purposes.\n-precert\nA poison extension will be added to the certificate, making it a \"pre-certificate\" (see RFC6962). This can be submitted to Certificate Transparency logs in order to obtain signed certificate timestamps (SCTs). These SCTs can then be embedded into the pre-certificate as an extension, before removing the poison and signing the certificate.\nThis implies the\n-new\nflag.\n-utf8\nThis option causes field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by default they are interpreted as ASCII. This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.\n-reqopt\noption\nCustomise the printing format used with\n-text\n. The\noption\nargument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.\nSee discussion of the\n-certopt\nparameter in the\nopenssl-x509(1)\ncommand.\n-newhdr\nAdds the word\nNEW\nto the PEM file header and footer lines on the outputted request. Some software (Netscape certificate server) and some CAs need this.\n-batch\nNon-interactive mode.\n-verbose\nPrint extra details about the operations being performed.\n-keygen_engine\nid\nSpecifies an engine (by its unique\nid\nstring) which would be used for key generation operations.\n-nameopt\noption\nThis specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed. See\nopenssl-namedisplay-options(1)\nfor details.\n-rand\nfiles\n,\n-writerand\nfile\nSee\n\"Random State Options\" in openssl(1)\nfor details.\n-engine\nid\nSee\n\"Engine Options\" in openssl(1)\n. This option is deprecated.\n-provider\nname\n-provider-path\npath\n-propquery\npropq\nSee\n\"Provider Options\" in openssl(1)\n,\nprovider(7)\n, and\nproperty(7)\n.\nCONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT\n¶\nThe configuration options are specified in the\nreq\nsection of the configuration file. An alternate name be specified by using the\n-section\noption. As with all configuration files, if no value is specified in the specific section then the initial unnamed or\ndefault\nsection is searched too.\nThe options available are described in detail below.\ninput_password\n,\noutput_password\nThe passwords for the input private key file (if present) and the output private key file (if one will be created). The command line options\npassin\nand\npassout\noverride the configuration file values.\ndefault_bits\nSpecifies the default key size in bits.\nThis option is used in conjunction with the\n-new\noption to generate a new key. It can be overridden by specifying an explicit key size in the\n-newkey\noption. The smallest accepted key size is 512 bits. If no key size is specified then 2048 bits is used.\ndefault_keyfile\nThis is the default filename to write a private key to. If not specified the key is written to standard output. This can be overridden by the\n-keyout\noption.\noid_file\nThis specifies a file containing additional\nOBJECT IDENTIFIERS\n. Each line of the file should consist of the numerical form of the object identifier followed by whitespace then the short name followed by whitespace and finally the long name.\noid_section\nThis specifies a section in the configuration file containing extra object identifiers. Each line should consist of the short name of the object identifier followed by\n=\nand the numerical form. The short and long names are the same when this option is used.\nRANDFILE\nAt startup the specified file is loaded into the random number generator, and at exit 256 bytes will be written to it. It is used for private key generation.\nencrypt_key\nIf this is set to\nno\nthen if a private key is generated it is\nnot\nencrypted. This is equivalent to the\n-noenc\ncommand line option. For compatibility\nencrypt_rsa_key\nis an equivalent option.\ndefault_md\nThis option specifies the digest algorithm to use. Any digest supported by the OpenSSL\ndgst\ncommand can be used. This option can be overridden on the command line. Certain signing algorithms (i.e. Ed25519 and Ed448) will ignore any digest that has been set.\nstring_mask\nThis option masks out the use of certain string types in certain fields. Most users will not need to change this option. It can be set to several values:\nutf8only\nonly UTF8Strings are used (this is the default value)\npkix\nany string type except T61Strings\nnombstr\nany string type except BMPStrings and UTF8Strings\ndefault\nany kind of string type\nNote that\nutf8only\nis the PKIX recommendation in RFC2459 after 2003, and the default\nstring_mask\n;\ndefault\nis not the default option. The\nnombstr\nvalue is a workaround for some software that has problems with variable-sized BMPStrings and UTF8Strings.\nreq_extensions\nThis specifies the configuration file section containing a list of extensions to add to the certificate request. It can be overridden by the\n-reqexts\ncommand line switch. See the\nx509v3_config(5)\nmanual page for details of the extension section format.\nx509_extensions\nThis specifies the configuration file section containing a list of extensions to add to certificate generated when\n-x509\nis in use. It can be overridden by the\n-extensions\ncommand line switch.\nprompt\nIf set to the value\nno\nthis disables prompting of certificate fields and just takes values from the config file directly. It also changes the expected format of the\ndistinguished_name\nand\nattributes\nsections.\nutf8\nIf set to the value\nyes\nthen field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by default they are interpreted as ASCII. This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or obtained from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.\nattributes\nThis specifies the section containing any request attributes: its format is the same as\ndistinguished_name\n. Typically these may contain the challengePassword or unstructuredName types. They are currently ignored by OpenSSL's request signing utilities but some CAs might want them.\ndistinguished_name\nThis specifies the section containing the distinguished name fields to prompt for when generating a certificate or certificate request. The format is described in the next section.\nDISTINGUISHED NAME AND ATTRIBUTE SECTION FORMAT\n¶\nThere are two separate formats for the distinguished name and attribute sections. If the\nprompt\noption is set to\nno\nthen these sections just consist of field names and values: for example,\nCN=My Name\nOU=My Organization\nemailAddress=someone@somewhere.org\nThis allows external programs (e.g. GUI based) to generate a template file with all the field names and values and just pass it to this command. An example of this kind of configuration file is contained in the\nEXAMPLES\nsection.\nAlternatively if the\nprompt\noption is absent or not set to\nno\nthen the file contains field prompting information. It consists of lines of the form:\nfieldName=\"prompt\"\nfieldName_default=\"default field value\"\nfieldName_min= 2\nfieldName_max= 4\n\"fieldName\" is the field name being used, for example commonName (or CN). The \"prompt\" string is used to ask the user to enter the relevant details. If the user enters nothing then the default value is used if no default value is present then the field is omitted. A field can still be omitted if a default value is present if the user just enters the '.' character.\nThe number of characters entered must be between the fieldName_min and fieldName_max limits: there may be additional restrictions based on the field being used (for example countryName can only ever be two characters long and must fit in a PrintableString).\nSome fields (such as organizationName) can be used more than once in a DN. This presents a problem because configuration files will not recognize the same name occurring twice. To avoid this problem if the fieldName contains some characters followed by a full stop they will be ignored. So for example a second organizationName can be input by calling it \"1.organizationName\".\nThe actual permitted field names are any object identifier short or long names. These are compiled into OpenSSL and include the usual values such as commonName, countryName, localityName, organizationName, organizationalUnitName, stateOrProvinceName. Additionally emailAddress is included as well as name, surname, givenName, initials, and dnQualifier.\nAdditional object identifiers can be defined with the\noid_file\nor\noid_section\noptions in the configuration file. Any additional fields will be treated as though they were a DirectoryString.\nEXAMPLES\n¶\nExamine and verify certificate request:\nopenssl req -in req.pem -text -verify -noout\nCreate a private key and then generate a certificate request from it:\nopenssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\nopenssl req -new -key key.pem -out req.pem\nThe same but just using req:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem\nGenerate a self-signed root certificate:\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem\nCreate an SM2 private key and then generate a certificate request from it:\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name SM2 -out sm2.key\nopenssl req -new -key sm2.key -out sm2.csr -sm3 -sigopt \"distid:1234567812345678\"\nExamine and verify an SM2 certificate request:\nopenssl req -verify -in sm2.csr -sm3 -vfyopt \"distid:1234567812345678\"\nExample of a file pointed to by the\noid_file\noption:\n1.2.3.4        shortName       A longer Name\n1.2.3.6        otherName       Other longer Name\nExample of a section pointed to by\noid_section\nmaking use of variable expansion:\ntestoid1=1.2.3.5\ntestoid2=${testoid1}.6\nSample configuration file prompting for field values:\n[ req ]\ndefault_bits           = 2048\ndefault_keyfile        = privkey.pem\ndistinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name\nattributes             = req_attributes\nreq_extensions         = v3_ca\ndirstring_type = nombstr\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\ncountryName                    = Country Name (2 letter code)\ncountryName_default            = AU\ncountryName_min                = 2\ncountryName_max                = 2\nlocalityName                   = Locality Name (eg, city)\norganizationalUnitName         = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)\ncommonName                     = Common Name (eg, YOUR name)\ncommonName_max                 = 64\nemailAddress                   = Email Address\nemailAddress_max               = 40\n[ req_attributes ]\nchallengePassword              = A challenge password\nchallengePassword_min          = 4\nchallengePassword_max          = 20\n[ v3_ca ]\nsubjectKeyIdentifier=hash\nauthorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer:always\nbasicConstraints = critical, CA:true\nSample configuration containing all field values:\n[ req ]\ndefault_bits           = 2048\ndefault_keyfile        = keyfile.pem\ndistinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name\nattributes             = req_attributes\nprompt                 = no\noutput_password        = mypass\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\nC                      = GB\nST                     = Test State or Province\nL                      = Test Locality\nO                      = Organization Name\nOU                     = Organizational Unit Name\nCN                     = Common Name\nemailAddress           = test@email.address\n[ req_attributes ]\nchallengePassword              = A challenge password\nExample of giving the most common attributes (subject and extensions) on the command line:\nopenssl req -new -subj \"/C=GB/CN=foo\" \\\n-addext \"subjectAltName = DNS:foo.co.uk\" \\\n-addext \"certificatePolicies = 1.2.3.4\" \\\n-newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem\nNOTES\n¶\nThe certificate requests generated by\nXenroll\nwith MSIE have extensions added. It includes the\nkeyUsage\nextension which determines the type of key (signature only or general purpose) and any additional OIDs entered by the script in an\nextendedKeyUsage\nextension.\nDIAGNOSTICS\n¶\nThe following messages are frequently asked about:\nUsing configuration from /some/path/openssl.cnf\nUnable to load config info\nThis is followed some time later by:\nunable to find 'distinguished_name' in config\nproblems making Certificate Request\nThe first error message is the clue: it can't find the configuration file! Certain operations (like examining a certificate request) don't need a configuration file so its use isn't enforced. Generation of certificates or requests however does need a configuration file. This could be regarded as a bug.\nAnother puzzling message is this:\nAttributes:\na0:00\nthis is displayed when no attributes are present and the request includes the correct empty\nSET OF\nstructure (the DER encoding of which is 0xa0 0x00). If you just see:\nAttributes:\nthen the\nSET OF\nis missing and the encoding is technically invalid (but it is tolerated). See the description of the command line option\n-asn1-kludge\nfor more information.\nBUGS\n¶\nOpenSSL's handling of T61Strings (aka TeletexStrings) is broken: it effectively treats them as ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), Netscape and MSIE have similar behaviour. This can cause problems if you need characters that aren't available in PrintableStrings and you don't want to or can't use BMPStrings.\nAs a consequence of the T61String handling the only correct way to represent accented characters in OpenSSL is to use a BMPString: unfortunately Netscape currently chokes on these. If you have to use accented characters with Netscape and MSIE then you currently need to use the invalid T61String form.\nThe current prompting is not very friendly. It doesn't allow you to confirm what you've just entered. Other things like extensions in certificate requests are statically defined in the configuration file. Some of these: like an email address in subjectAltName should be input by the user.\nSEE ALSO\n¶\nopenssl(1)\n,\nopenssl-x509(1)\n,\nopenssl-ca(1)\n,\nopenssl-genrsa(1)\n,\nopenssl-gendsa(1)\n,\nconfig(5)\n,\nx509v3_config(5)\nHISTORY\n¶\nThe\n-section\noption was added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.\nThe\n-multivalue-rdn\noption has become obsolete in OpenSSL 3.0.0 and has no effect.\nThe\n-engine\noption was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

It can be used to print certificate information, convert certificates to various forms, edit certificate trust settings, generate certificates from scratch or from certificating requests and then self-signing them or signing them like a \"micro CA\".\nSince there are a large number of options they will split up into various sections.\nOPTIONS\n¶\nInput, Output, and General Purpose Options\n¶\n-help\nPrint out a usage message.\n-in\nfilename\n|\nuri\nThis specifies the input to read a certificate from or the input file for reading a certificate request if the\n-req\nflag is used. In both cases this defaults to standard input.\nThis option cannot be combined with the\n-new\nflag.\n-passin\narg\nThe key and certificate file password source. For more information about the format of\narg\nsee\nopenssl-passphrase-options(1)\n.\n-new\nGenerate a certificate from scratch, not using an input certificate or certificate request. So the\n-in\noption must not be used in this case. Instead, the\n-subj\noption needs to be given. The public key to include can be given with the\n-force_pubkey\noption and defaults to the key given with the\n-key\n(or\n-signkey\n) option, which implies self-signature.\n-x509toreq\nOutput a PKCS#10 certificate request (rather than a certificate). The\n-key\n(or\n-signkey\n) option must be used to provide the private key for self-signing; the corresponding public key is placed in the subjectPKInfo field.\nX.509 extensions included in a certificate input are not copied by default. X.509 extensions to be added can be specified using the\n-extfile\noption.\n-req\nBy default a certificate is expected on input. With this option a PKCS#10 certificate request is expected instead, which must be correctly self-signed.\nX.509 extensions included in the request are not copied by default. X.509 extensions to be added can be specified using the\n-extfile\noption.\n-copy_extensions\narg\nDetermines how to handle X.509 extensions when converting from a certificate to a request using the\n-x509toreq\noption or converting from a request to a certificate using the\n-req\noption. If\narg\nis\nnone\nor this option is not present then extensions are ignored. If\narg\nis\ncopy\nor\ncopyall\nthen all extensions are copied, except that subject identifier and authority key identifier extensions are not taken over when producing a certificate request.\nThe\n-ext\noption can be used to further restrict which extensions to copy.\n-inform\nDER\n|\nPEM\nThe input file format; unspecified by default. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\n-vfyopt\nnm\n:\nv\nPass options to the signature algorithm during verify operations. Names and values of these options are algorithm-specific.\n-key\nfilename\n|\nuri\nThis option provides the private key for signing a new certificate or certificate request. Unless\n-force_pubkey\nis given, the corresponding public key is placed in the new certificate or certificate request, resulting in a self-signature.\nThis option cannot be used in conjunction with the\n-CA\noption.\nIt sets the issuer name to the subject name (i.e., makes it self-issued) and changes the public key to the supplied value (unless overridden by\n-force_pubkey\n). Unless the\n-preserve_dates\noption is supplied, it sets the validity start date to the current time and the end date to a value determined by the\n-days\noption.\n-signkey\nfilename\n|\nuri\nThis option is an alias of\n-key\n.\n-keyform\nDER\n|\nPEM\n|\nP12\n|\nENGINE\nThe key input format; unspecified by default. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\n-out\nfilename\nThis specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by default.\n-outform\nDER\n|\nPEM\nThe output format; the default is\nPEM\n. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\n-nocert\nDo not output a certificate (except for printing as requested by below options).\n-noout\nThis option prevents output except for printing as requested by below options.\nCertificate Printing Options\n¶\nNote: the\n-alias\nand\n-purpose\noptions are also printing options but are described in the\n\"Trust Settings\"\nsection.\n-dateopt\nSpecify the date output format. Values are: rfc_822 and iso_8601. Defaults to rfc_822.\n-text\nPrints out the certificate in text form. Full details are printed including the public key, signature algorithms, issuer and subject names, serial number any extensions present and any trust settings.\n-certopt\noption\nCustomise the print format used with\n-text\n. The\noption\nargument can be a single option or multiple options separated by commas. The\n-certopt\nswitch may be also be used more than once to set multiple options. See the\n\"Text Printing Flags\"\nsection for more information.\n-fingerprint\nCalculates and prints the digest of the DER encoded version of the entire certificate (see digest options). This is commonly called a \"fingerprint\". Because of the nature of message digests, the fingerprint of a certificate is unique to that certificate and two certificates with the same fingerprint can be considered to be the same.\n-alias\nPrints the certificate \"alias\" (nickname), if any.\n-serial\nPrints the certificate serial number.\n-startdate\nPrints out the start date of the certificate, that is the notBefore date.\n-enddate\nPrints out the expiry date of the certificate, that is the notAfter date.\n-dates\nPrints out the start and expiry dates of a certificate.\n-subject\nPrints the subject name.\n-issuer\nPrints the issuer name.\n-nameopt\noption\nThis specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed. See\nopenssl-namedisplay-options(1)\nfor details.\n-email\nPrints the email address(es) if any.\n-hash\nSynonym for \"-subject_hash\" for backward compatibility reasons.\n-subject_hash\nPrints the \"hash\" of the certificate subject name. This is used in OpenSSL to form an index to allow certificates in a directory to be looked up by subject name.\n-subject_hash_old\nPrints the \"hash\" of the certificate subject name using the older algorithm as used by OpenSSL before version 1.0.0.\n-issuer_hash\nPrints the \"hash\" of the certificate issuer name.\n-issuer_hash_old\nPrints the \"hash\" of the certificate issuer name using the older algorithm as used by OpenSSL before version 1.0.0.\n-ext\nextensions\nPrints out the certificate extensions in text form. Can also be used to restrict which extensions to copy. Extensions are specified with a comma separated string, e.g., \"subjectAltName,subjectKeyIdentifier\". See the\nx509v3_config(5)\nmanual page for the extension names.\n-ocspid\nPrints the OCSP hash values for the subject name and public key.\n-ocsp_uri\nPrints the OCSP responder address(es) if any.\n-purpose\nThis option performs tests on the certificate extensions and outputs the results. For a more complete description see\n\"Certificate Extensions\" in openssl-verification-options(1)\n.\n-pubkey\nPrints the certificate's SubjectPublicKeyInfo block in PEM format.\n-modulus\nThis option prints out the value of the modulus of the public key contained in the certificate.\nCertificate Checking Options\n¶\n-checkend\narg\nChecks if the certificate expires within the next\narg\nseconds and exits nonzero if yes it will expire or zero if not.\n-checkhost\nhost\nCheck that the certificate matches the specified host.\n-checkemail\nemail\nCheck that the certificate matches the specified email address.\n-checkip\nipaddr\nCheck that the certificate matches the specified IP address.\nCertificate Output Options\n¶\n-set_serial\nn\nSpecifies the serial number to use. This option can be used with the\n-key\n,\n-signkey\n, or\n-CA\noptions. If used in conjunction with the\n-CA\noption the serial number file (as specified by the\n-CAserial\noption) is not used.\nThe serial number can be decimal or hex (if preceded by\n0x\n).\n-next_serial\nSet the serial to be one more than the number in the certificate.\n-days\narg\nSpecifies the number of days until a newly generated certificate expires. The default is 30. Cannot be used together with the\n-preserve_dates\noption.\n-preserve_dates\nWhen signing a certificate, preserve \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates of any input certificate instead of adjusting them to current time and duration. Cannot be used together with the\n-days\noption.\n-subj\narg\nWhen a certificate is created set its subject name to the given value. When the certificate is self-signed the issuer name is set to the same value.\nThe arg must be formatted as\n/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...\n. Special characters may be escaped by\n\\\n(backslash), whitespace is retained. Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included in the certificate. Giving a single\n/\nwill lead to an empty sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN). Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a\n+\ncharacter instead of a\n/\nbetween the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the set. Example:\n/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe\nThis option can be used in conjunction with the\n-force_pubkey\noption to create a certificate even without providing an input certificate or certificate request.\n-force_pubkey\nfilename\nWhen a certificate is created set its public key to the key in\nfilename\ninstead of the key contained in the input or given with the\n-key\n(or\n-signkey\n) option.\nThis option is useful for creating self-issued certificates that are not self-signed, for instance when the key cannot be used for signing, such as DH. It can also be used in conjunction with\n-new\nand\n-subj\nto directly generate a certificate containing any desired public key.\n-clrext\nWhen transforming a certificate to a new certificate by default all certificate extensions are retained.\nWhen transforming a certificate or certificate request, the\n-clrext\noption prevents taking over any extensions from the source. In any case, when producing a certificate request, neither subject identifier nor authority key identifier extensions are included.\n-extfile\nfilename\nConfiguration file containing certificate and request X.509 extensions to add.\n-extensions\nsection\nThe section in the extfile to add X.509 extensions from. If this option is not specified then the extensions should either be contained in the unnamed (default) section or the default section should contain a variable called \"extensions\" which contains the section to use. See the\nx509v3_config(5)\nmanual page for details of the extension section format.\n-sigopt\nnm\n:\nv\nPass options to the signature algorithm during sign operations. This option may be given multiple times. Names and values provided using this option are algorithm-specific.\n-badsig\nCorrupt the signature before writing it; this can be useful for testing.\n-\ndigest\nThe digest to use. This affects any signing or printing option that uses a message digest, such as the\n-fingerprint\n,\n-key\n, and\n-CA\noptions. Any digest supported by the\nopenssl-dgst(1)\ncommand can be used. If not specified then SHA1 is used with\n-fingerprint\nor the default digest for the signing algorithm is used, typically SHA256.\nMicro-CA Options\n¶\n-CA\nfilename\n|\nuri\nSpecifies the \"CA\" certificate to be used for signing. When present, this behaves like a \"micro CA\" as follows: The subject name of the \"CA\" certificate is placed as issuer name in the new certificate, which is then signed using the \"CA\" key given as detailed below.\nThis option cannot be used in conjunction with\n-key\n(or\n-signkey\n). This option is normally combined with the\n-req\noption referencing a CSR. Without the\n-req\noption the input must be an existing certificate unless the\n-new\noption is given, which generates a certificate from scratch.\n-CAform\nDER\n|\nPEM\n|\nP12\n,\nThe format for the CA certificate; unspecified by default. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\n-CAkey\nfilename\n|\nuri\nSets the CA private key to sign a certificate with. The private key must match the public key of the certificate given with\n-CA\n. If this option is not provided then the key must be present in the\n-CA\ninput.\n-CAkeyform\nDER\n|\nPEM\n|\nP12\n|\nENGINE\nThe format for the CA key; unspecified by default. See\nopenssl-format-options(1)\nfor details.\n-CAserial\nfilename\nSets the CA serial number file to use.\nWhen creating a certificate with this option and with the\n-CA\noption, the certificate serial number is stored in the given file. This file consists of one line containing an even number of hex digits with the serial number used last time. After reading this number, it is incremented and used, and the file is updated.\nThe default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name with\n.srl\nappended. For example if the CA certificate file is called\nmycacert.pem\nit expects to find a serial number file called\nmycacert.srl\n.\nIf the\n-CA\noption is specified and neither <-CAserial> or <-CAcreateserial> is given and the default serial number file does not exist, a random number is generated; this is the recommended practice.\n-CAcreateserial\nWith this option and the\n-CA\noption the CA serial number file is created if it does not exist. A random number is generated, used for the certificate, and saved into the serial number file determined as described above.\nTrust Settings\n¶\nA\ntrusted certificate\nis an ordinary certificate which has several additional pieces of information attached to it such as the permitted and prohibited uses of the certificate and possibly an \"alias\" (nickname).\nNormally when a certificate is being verified at least one certificate must be \"trusted\". By default a trusted certificate must be stored locally and must be a root CA: any certificate chain ending in this CA is then usable for any purpose.\nTrust settings currently are only used with a root CA. They allow a finer control over the purposes the root CA can be used for. For example, a CA may be trusted for SSL client but not SSL server use.\nSee\nopenssl-verification-options(1)\nfor more information on the meaning of trust settings.\nFuture versions of OpenSSL will recognize trust settings on any certificate: not just root CAs.\n-trustout\nMark any certificate PEM output as <trusted> certificate rather than ordinary. An ordinary or trusted certificate can be input but by default an ordinary certificate is output and any trust settings are discarded. With the\n-trustout\noption a trusted certificate is output. A trusted certificate is automatically output if any trust settings are modified.\n-setalias\narg\nSets the \"alias\" of the certificate. This will allow the certificate to be referred to using a nickname for example \"Steve's Certificate\".\n-clrtrust\nClears all the permitted or trusted uses of the certificate.\n-addtrust\narg\nAdds a trusted certificate use. Any object name can be used here but currently only\nclientAuth\n,\nserverAuth\n,\nemailProtection\n, and\nanyExtendedKeyUsage\nare defined. As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, the last of these blocks all purposes when rejected or enables all purposes when trusted. Other OpenSSL applications may define additional uses.\n-clrreject\nClears all the prohibited or rejected uses of the certificate.\n-addreject\narg\nAdds a prohibited trust anchor purpose. It accepts the same values as the\n-addtrust\noption.\nGeneric options\n¶\n-rand\nfiles\n,\n-writerand\nfile\nSee\n\"Random State Options\" in openssl(1)\nfor details.\n-engine\nid\nSee\n\"Engine Options\" in openssl(1)\n. This option is deprecated.\n-provider\nname\n-provider-path\npath\n-propquery\npropq\nSee\n\"Provider Options\" in openssl(1)\n,\nprovider(7)\n, and\nproperty(7)\n.\nText Printing Flags\n¶\nAs well as customising the name printing format, it is also possible to customise the actual fields printed using the\ncertopt\noption when the\ntext\noption is present. The default behaviour is to print all fields.\ncompatible\nUse the old format. This is equivalent to specifying no printing options at all.\nno_header\nDon't print header information: that is the lines saying \"Certificate\" and \"Data\".\nno_version\nDon't print out the version number.\nno_serial\nDon't print out the serial number.\nno_signame\nDon't print out the signature algorithm used.\nno_validity\nDon't print the validity, that is the\nnotBefore\nand\nnotAfter\nfields.\nno_subject\nDon't print out the subject name.\nno_issuer\nDon't print out the issuer name.\nno_pubkey\nDon't print out the public key.\nno_sigdump\nDon't give a hexadecimal dump of the certificate signature.\nno_aux\nDon't print out certificate trust information.\nno_extensions\nDon't print out any X509V3 extensions.\next_default\nRetain default extension behaviour: attempt to print out unsupported certificate extensions.\next_error\nPrint an error message for unsupported certificate extensions.\next_parse\nASN1 parse unsupported extensions.\next_dump\nHex dump unsupported extensions.\nca_default\nThe value used by\nopenssl-ca(1)\n, equivalent to\nno_issuer\n,\nno_pubkey\n,\nno_header\n, and\nno_version\n.\nEXAMPLES\n¶\nNote: in these examples the '\\' means the example should be all on one line.\nPrint the contents of a certificate:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -text\nPrint the \"Subject Alternative Name\" extension of a certificate:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -ext subjectAltName\nPrint more extensions of a certificate:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -ext subjectAltName,nsCertType\nPrint the certificate serial number:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -serial\nPrint the certificate subject name:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject\nPrint the certificate subject name in RFC2253 form:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject -nameopt RFC2253\nPrint the certificate subject name in oneline form on a terminal supporting UTF8:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject -nameopt oneline,-esc_msb\nPrint the certificate SHA1 fingerprint:\nopenssl x509 -sha1 -in cert.pem -noout -fingerprint\nConvert a certificate from PEM to DER format:\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -inform PEM -out cert.der -outform DER\nConvert a certificate to a certificate request:\nopenssl x509 -x509toreq -in cert.pem -out req.pem -key key.pem\nConvert a certificate request into a self-signed certificate using extensions for a CA:\nopenssl x509 -req -in careq.pem -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_ca \\\n-key key.pem -out cacert.pem\nSign a certificate request using the CA certificate above and add user certificate extensions:\nopenssl x509 -req -in req.pem -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_usr \\\n-CA cacert.pem -CAkey key.pem -CAcreateserial\nSet a certificate to be trusted for SSL client use and change set its alias to \"Steve's Class 1 CA\"\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -addtrust clientAuth \\\n-setalias \"Steve's Class 1 CA\" -out trust.pem\nNOTES\n¶\nThe conversion to UTF8 format used with the name options assumes that T61Strings use the ISO8859-1 character set. This is wrong but Netscape and MSIE do this as do many certificates. So although this is incorrect it is more likely to print the majority of certificates correctly.\nThe\n-email\noption searches the subject name and the subject alternative name extension. Only unique email addresses will be printed out: it will not print the same address more than once.\nBUGS\n¶\nIt is possible to produce invalid certificates or requests by specifying the wrong private key, using unsuitable X.509 extensions, or using inconsistent options in some cases: these should be checked.\nThere should be options to explicitly set such things as start and end dates rather than an offset from the current time.\nSEE ALSO\n¶\nopenssl(1)\n,\nopenssl-req(1)\n,\nopenssl-ca(1)\n,\nopenssl-genrsa(1)\n,\nopenssl-gendsa(1)\n,\nopenssl-verify(1)\n,\nx509v3_config(5)\nHISTORY\n¶\nThe hash algorithm used in the\n-subject_hash\nand\n-issuer_hash\noptions before OpenSSL 1.0.0 was based on the deprecated MD5 algorithm and the encoding of the distinguished name. In OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later it is based on a canonical version of the DN using SHA1. This means that any directories using the old form must have their links rebuilt using\nopenssl-rehash(1)\nor similar.\nThe\n-signkey\noption has been renamed to\n-key\nin OpenSSL 3.0, keeping the old name as an alias.\nThe\n-engine\noption was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.\nThe\n-C\noption was removed in OpenSSL 3.0.\nCOPYRIGHT\n¶\nCopyright 2000-2023 The OpenSSL Project Authors.
