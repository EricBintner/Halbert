This is work that impacts focus and distracts from goals and business objectives.\nLivepatch reduces the unplanned work of installing Linux kernel security updates, making you more effective when managing Ubuntu systems.\nReduce downtime\nDowntime is one of the major pains of every service provider, and it is unavoidable when deploying vulnerability\nfixes on the Linux kernel in the traditional way. That’s because the updated system needs to be rebooted,\npotentially disrupting\nKubernetes\n,\nOpenStack\n, virtualized,\nor\nbare-metal\nworkloads. Industry leaders avoid this problem and achieve high uptime by livepatching between scheduled maintenance windows.\nEnhanced security\nWith early and cumulative patching of kernel vulnerabilities, Livepatch helps users maintain a strong security posture, and reduces the risk of exploits.\nFollow organizational policy\nLivepatch allows you to define your rollout policy and remain in full control of which machines will get updated and when, as well as provide updates to isolated network environments. System administrators can set a patching cut-off date and a patching delay on each machine, and uniformly secure groups of machines.\nEase of use\nLivepatch is designed to be straightforward to set up and use, and patches are applied automatically after activation. Livepatch integrates with Canonical's web and API based Linux administration tool:\nLandscape\n.\nGet in touch\nLivepatch is used by\nKernel livepatching at a glance\nWhen a high or critical Linux kernel vulnerability is detected a livepatch along with a\nLivepatch Security Notice\nare issued. Systems that enable the livepatch client will receive and apply the patch, after it is made available. The livepatch will provide new kernel code replacing the vulnerable one, and will update the rest of the kernel to use the new code.\nExplore kernels covered by Livepatch\nLearn more about how kernel livepatching works ›\nLivepatch on-prem overview\nLivepatch on-prem is designed for air gapped environments where Livepatch Client is unavailable to access security endpoints in Canonical's cloud. Livepatch on-prem can be updated with the latest patches, and Livepatch Client can retrieve the updates from Livepatch on-prem, instead of Canonical's cloud.\nLearn more about Livepatch on-prem server ›\nWhat our customers say\n“Livepatch is a perfect fit for our needs. There’s no other solution like it, and it’s highly cost-effective. Manually migrating virtual machines, applying kernel updates, and rebooting took an average of 32 hours per server. Multiplied by 80 servers, that was more than 2,500 hours of work.”\nShinya Tsunematsu\nSenior Engineering Lead\nTech Division, GMO Pepabo\nRead the GMO Pepabo case study ›\n“Livepatch is like a dream come true, both from a technical and a business standpoint. Our Ubuntu systems now rarely, or never, have to be rebooted. Service is continuous. That makes a big difference for user and customer satisfaction and loyalty.”\nMasaaki Hirose\nIT Platform Department\nDeNA\nGet Livepatch with Ubuntu Pro\nFree for personal use\nLivepatch is available free for up to 5 machines, for personal use, or evaluation purposes.\nTry a free subscription ›\nPart of Ubuntu Pro\nGet Livepatch with an Ubuntu Pro subscription from Canonical.\nGet Ubuntu Pro\nHow to enable\nthe Ubuntu Livepatch service\n1      Attach your subscription\nsudo pro attach [TOKEN]\nNote: obtain the subscription token via the\nUbuntu Pro portal\n.\n2      Enable Livepatch on your system\nsudo pro enable livepatch\nCanonical Livepatch resources\nWebinar\nBest practices for security patching automations\nDocumentation\nLivepatch documentation\nDatasheet\nProduct overview and benefits\nTerms of Service\nLivepatch terms of service\nFrequently Asked Questions\nShould every vulnerability be Livepatched?\nCanonical Livepatch patches kernel vulnerabilities with critical and high Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and\nUbuntu Priority\nratings. Canonical targets vulnerabilities that have security implications, such as privilege escalation or remote code execution, and are practical to patch safely in-memory.\nCanonical Livepatch does not patch userspace libraries like OpenSSL or glibc, because that is the responsibility of\nunattended-upgrades\nor a systems management tool, like\nCanonical Landscape\n.\nCan Livepatch trap me in a patched state?\nCanonical Livepatch prevents the risk of instability by providing cumulative patches instead of stacking incremental ones,\nwhich makes rollbacks unnecessary in practice.\nJust like every Ubuntu kernel package, Canonical runs every Livepatch through the same testing and rigor. Each patch is tested cumulatively with previous patches, on real hardware, without emulation. Livepatch Client downloads a single cumulative patch for the running kernel. In practice, the failure rate of\nCanonical Livepatch deployments is vanishingly small, and for Canonical Livepatch, reboots remain the safest and most sensible rollback path.\nIs Livepatch a substitute for upgrade and reboot?\nCanonical Livepatch is not a replacement for rebooting. It is a tool that gives you more control by preventing unscheduled reboots. Reboots cleanly flush accumulated state inconsistencies from memory leaks, hung file handles, and other problems that could fester with long uptime. Eliminating reboots would expose any operating system to these inefficiencies over time. Trying to avoid all reboots results in incomplete security patching coverage, and leads to fragile patching strategies that involve service restarts and error prone dependency tracing. Scheduling reboots ensures a guaranteed clean slate.\nLivepatch is free to use on your own PC or server.\nTalk to our team and learn how Livepatch can secure your organization ›\nClose\nUnleash open source in your business\nWhere would you like to go faster?\nInfrastructure\nApplications\nDevelopment\nOperations\nManaged services\nMulti cloud\nOn premises\nEdge\nHPC\nServers\nVirtual machines\nDesktops\nAppliances\nShould we bring a particular expert to the discussion?\nKubernetes\nOpenstack\nKernel\nDevSecOps\nHigh availability\nService catalog\nScale\nPerformance\nVMware\nDocker\nSnaps\nStorage\nNetworking\nDatabases\nMessage queues\nWeb applications\nBig data\nEvent streams\nLogging\nMonitoring\nAlerting\nAI / ML\nTensorflow\nKubeflow\nPyTorch\nNumPy\nElasticSearch\nKafka\nGraylog\nCeph\nCompliance\nLicensing\nPCI-DSS\nOutsourcing\nOrchestration\nIntegration\nPackaging\nTell us about your project or interest\nHow should we get in touch?\nFirst name:\nLast name:\nEmail:\nCompany:\nJob Title:\nCountry:\nSelect...\nFrance\nGermany\nJapan\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States of America\n——————————————————\nAfghanistan\nÅland Islands\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerican Samoa\nAndorra\nAngola\nAnguilla\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArgentina\nArmenia\nAruba\nAustralia\nAustria\nAzerbaijan\nBahamas\nBahrain\nBangladesh\nBarbados\nBelarus\nBelgium\nBelize\nBenin\nBermuda\nBhutan\nBolivia (Plurinational State of)\nBonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana\nBouvet Island\nBrazil\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory\nBrunei Darussalam\nBulgaria\nBurkina Faso\nBurundi\nCambodia\nCameroon\nCanada\nCabo Verde\nCayman Islands\nCentral African Republic\nChad\nChile\nChina\nChristmas Island\nCocos (Keeling) Islands\nColombia\nComoros\nCongo\nCongo (Democratic Republic of the)\nCook Islands\nCosta Rica\nCôte d'Ivoire\nCroatia\nCuba\nCuraçao\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nDjibouti\nDominica\nDominican Republic\nEcuador\nEgypt\nEl Salvador\nEquatorial Guinea\nEritrea\nEstonia\nEthiopia\nFalkland Islands (Malvinas)\nFaroe Islands\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nFrench Guiana\nFrench Polynesia\nFrench Southern Territories\nGabon\nGambia\nGeorgia\nGermany\nGhana\nGibraltar\nGreece\nGreenland\nGrenada\nGuadeloupe\nGuam\nGuatemala\nGuernsey\nGuinea\nGuinea-Bissau\nGuyana\nHaiti\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands\nHoly See\nHonduras\nHong Kong\nHungary\nIceland\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran (Islamic Republic of)\nIraq\nIreland\nIsle of Man\nIsrael\nItaly\nJamaica\nJapan\nJersey\nJordan\nKazakhstan\nKenya\nKiribati\nKorea (Democratic People's Republic of)\nKorea (Republic of)\nKuwait\nKyrgyzstan\nLao People's Democratic Republic\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLesotho\nLiberia\nLibya\nLiechtenstein\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMacao\nMacedonia (the former Yugoslav Republic of)\nMadagascar\nMalawi\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nMali\nMalta\nMarshall Islands\nMartinique\nMauritania\nMauritius\nMayotte\nMexico\nMicronesia (Federated States of)\nMoldova (Republic of)\nMonaco\nMongolia\nMontenegro\nMontserrat\nMorocco\nMozambique\nMyanmar\nNamibia\nNauru\nNepal\nNetherlands\nNew Caledonia\nNew Zealand\nNicaragua\nNiger\nNigeria\nNiue\nNorfolk Island\nNorthern Mariana Islands\nNorway\nOman\nPakistan\nPalau\nPalestine, State of\nPanama\nPapua New Guinea\nParaguay\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPitcairn\nPoland\nPortugal\nPuerto Rico\nQatar\nRéunion\nRomania\nRussian Federation\nRwanda\nSaint Barthélemy\nSaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\nSaint Lucia\nSaint Martin (French part)\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSamoa\nSan Marino\nSao Tome and Principe\nSaudi Arabia\nSenegal\nSerbia\nSeychelles\nSierra Leone\nSingapore\nSint Maarten (Dutch part)\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSolomon Islands\nSomalia\nSouth Africa\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\nSouth Sudan\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nSudan\nSuriname\nSvalbard and Jan Mayen\nSwaziland\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nSyrian Arab Republic\nTaiwan\nTajikistan\nTanzania, United Republic of\nThailand\nTimor-Leste\nTogo\nTokelau\nTonga\nTrinidad and Tobago\nTunisia\nTurkey\nTurkmenistan\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nTuvalu\nUganda\nUkraine\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States of America\nUnited States Minor Outlying Islands\nUruguay\nUzbekistan\nVanuatu\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\nViet Nam\nVirgin Islands (British)\nVirgin Islands (U.S.)\nWallis and Futuna\nWestern Sahara\nYemen\nZambia\nZimbabwe\nMobile/cell phone number:\nI agree to receive\ninformation about\nCanonical's products and services.\nBy submitting this form, I confirm that I have read and agree to\nCanonical's Privacy Notice\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nWebsite:\nName:\nSubmit\nYour comments", "metadata": {"source_type": "vendor_docs", "trust": "vendor_docs", "os": "linux", "distro": "ubuntu-22.04", "license": "CC BY-SA (assumed; verify per site)", "attribution_url": "https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch"}}
