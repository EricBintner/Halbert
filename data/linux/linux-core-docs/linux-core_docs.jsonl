It is a\nreimplementation and extension of the Bourne shell, the historical\nUnix command language interpreter.\nBash\nalso incorporates useful\nfeatures from the\nKorn\nand\nC\nshells (\nksh\nand\ncsh\n).\nPOSIX is the name for a family of computing standards based on\nUnix.\nBash\nis intended to be a conformant implementation of the\nShell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE\nStandard 1003.1).\nBash\nPOSIX mode (hereafter referred to as\nposix\nmode\n) changes the shell's behavior where its default operation\ndiffers from the standard to strictly conform to the standard.\nSee\nSEE ALSO\nbelow for a reference to a document that details how\nposix mode affects\nbash\n's behavior.\nBash\ncan be configured to be\nPOSIX-conformant by default.\nOPTIONS\ntop\nAll of the single-character shell options documented in the\ndescription of the\nset\nbuiltin command, including\n-o\n, can be used\nas options when the shell is invoked.  In addition,\nbash\ninterprets the following options when it is invoked:\n-c\nIf the\n-c\noption is present, then commands are read from\nthe first non-option argument\ncommand_string\n.  If there are\narguments after the\ncommand_string\n, the first argument is\nassigned to\n$0\nand any remaining arguments are assigned to\nthe positional parameters.  The assignment to\n$0\nsets the\nname of the shell, which is used in warning and error\nmessages.\n-i\nIf the\n-i\noption is present, the shell is\ninteractive\n.\n-l\nMake\nbash\nact as if it had been invoked as a login shell\n(see\nINVOCATION\nbelow).\n-r\nIf the\n-r\noption is present, the shell becomes\nrestricted\n(see\nRESTRICTED SHELL\nbelow).\n-s\nIf the\n-s\noption is present, or if no arguments remain\nafter option processing, the shell reads commands from the\nstandard input.  This option allows the positional\nparameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell or\nwhen reading input through a pipe.\n-D\nPrint a list of all double-quoted strings preceded by\n$\non\nthe standard output.  These are the strings that are\nsubject to language translation when the current locale is\nnot\nC\nor\nPOSIX\n.  This implies the\n-n\noption; no commands\nwill be executed.\n[-+]O [\nshopt_option\n]\nshopt_option\nis one of the shell options accepted by the\nshopt\nbuiltin (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).  If\nshopt_option\nis present,\n-O\nsets the value of that option;\n+O\nunsets it.  If\nshopt_option\nis not supplied,\nbash\nprints\nthe names and values of the shell options accepted by\nshopt\non the standard output.  If the invocation option is\n+O\n,\nthe output is displayed in a format that may be reused as\ninput.\n--\nA\n--\nsignals the end of options and disables further option\nprocessing.  Any arguments after the\n--\nare treated as a\nshell script filename (see below) and arguments passed to\nthat script.  An argument of\n-\nis equivalent to\n--\n.\nBash\nalso interprets a number of multi-character options.  These\noptions must appear on the command line before the single-\ncharacter options to be recognized.\n--debugger\nArrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the\nshell starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see the\ndescription of the\nextdebug\noption to the\nshopt\nbuiltin\nbelow).\n--dump-po-strings\nEquivalent to\n-D\n, but the output is in the GNU\ngettext\nâpoâ\n(portable object) file format.\n--dump-strings\nEquivalent to\n-D\n.\n--help\nDisplay a usage message on standard output and exit\nsuccessfully.\n--init-file\nfile\n--rcfile\nfile\nExecute commands from\nfile\ninstead of the standard personal\ninitialization file\n~/.bashrc\nif the shell is interactive\n(see\nINVOCATION\nbelow).\n--login\nEquivalent to\n-l\n.\n--noediting\nDo not use the GNU\nreadline\nlibrary to read command lines\nwhen the shell is interactive.\n--noprofile\nDo not read either the system-wide startup file\n/etc/profile\nor any of the personal initialization files\n~/.bash_profile\n,\n~/.bash_login\n, or\n~/.profile\n.  By default,\nbash\nreads these files when it is invoked as a login shell\n(see\nINVOCATION\nbelow).\n--norc\nDo not read and execute the personal initialization file\n~/.bashrc\nif the shell is interactive.  This option is on\nby default if the shell is invoked as\nsh\n.\n--posix\nEnable posix mode; change the behavior of\nbash\nwhere the\ndefault operation differs from the POSIX standard to match\nthe standard.\n--restricted\nThe shell becomes restricted (see\nRESTRICTED SHELL\nbelow).\n--verbose\nEquivalent to\n-v\n.\n--version\nShow version information for this instance of\nbash\non the\nstandard output and exit successfully.\nARGUMENTS\ntop\nIf arguments remain after option processing, and neither the\n-c\nnor the\n-s\noption has been supplied, the first argument is treated\nas the name of a file containing shell commands (a\nshell script\n).\nWhen\nbash\nis invoked in this fashion,\n$0\nis set to the name of the\nfile, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining\narguments.\nBash\nreads and executes commands from this file, then\nexits.\nBash\n's exit status is the exit status of the last command\nexecuted in the script.  If no commands are executed, the exit\nstatus is 0.\nBash\nfirst attempts to open the file in the current\ndirectory, and, if no file is found, searches the directories in\nPATH\nfor the script.\nINVOCATION\ntop\nA\nlogin shell\nis one whose first character of argument zero is a\n-\n, or one started with the\n--login\noption.\nAn\ninteractive shell\nis one started without non-option arguments\n(unless\n-s\nis specified) and without the\n-c\noption, and whose\nstandard input and standard error are both connected to terminals\n(as determined by\nisatty(3)\n), or one started with the\n-i\noption.\nBash\nsets\nPS1\nand\n$-\nincludes\ni\nif the shell is interactive, so a\nshell script or a startup file can test this state.\nThe following paragraphs describe how\nbash\nexecutes its startup\nfiles.  If any of the files exist but cannot be read,\nbash\nreports\nan error.  Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below\nunder\nTilde Expansion\nin the\nEXPANSION\nsection.\nWhen\nbash\nis invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-\ninteractive shell with the\n--login\noption, it first reads and\nexecutes commands from the file\n/etc/profile\n, if that file exists.\nAfter reading that file, it looks for\n~/.bash_profile\n,\n~/.bash_login\n, and\n~/.profile\n, in that order, and reads and\nexecutes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.\nThe\n--noprofile\noption may be used when the shell is started to\ninhibit this behavior.\nWhen an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login\nshell executes the\nexit\nbuiltin command,\nbash\nreads and executes\ncommands from the file\n~/.bash_logout\n, if it exists.\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started,\nbash\nreads and executes commands from\n~/.bashrc\n, if that file\nexists.  The\n--norc\noption inhibits this behavior.  The\n--rcfile\nfile\noption causes\nbash\nto use\nfile\ninstead of\n~/.bashrc\n.\nWhen\nbash\nis started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for\nexample, it looks for the variable\nBASH_ENV\nin the environment,\nexpands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value\nas the name of a file to read and execute.\nBash\nbehaves as if the\nfollowing command were executed:\nif [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\nbut does not use the value of the\nPATH\nvariable to search for the\nfilename.\nIf\nbash\nis invoked with the name\nsh\n, it tries to mimic the startup\nbehavior of historical versions of\nsh\nas closely as possible,\nwhile conforming to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as\nan interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the\n--login\noption, it first attempts to read and execute commands\nfrom\n/etc/profile\nand\n~/.profile\n, in that order.  The\n--noprofile\noption inhibits this behavior.  When invoked as an interactive\nshell with the name\nsh\n,\nbash\nlooks for the variable\nENV\n, expands\nits value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the\nname of a file to read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as\nsh\ndoes not attempt to read and execute commands from any other\nstartup files, the\n--rcfile\noption has no effect.  A non-\ninteractive shell invoked with the name\nsh\ndoes not attempt to\nread any other startup files.\nWhen invoked as\nsh\n,\nbash\nenters posix mode after reading the\nstartup files.\nWhen\nbash\nis started in posix mode, as with the\n--posix\ncommand\nline option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In\nthis mode, interactive shells expand the\nENV\nvariable and read and\nexecute commands from the file whose name is the expanded value.\nNo other startup files are read.\nBash\nattempts to determine when it is being run with its standard\ninput connected to a network connection, as when executed by the\nhistorical and rarely-seen remote shell daemon, usually\nrshd\n, or\nthe secure shell daemon\nsshd\n.  If\nbash\ndetermines it is being run\nnon-interactively in this fashion, it reads and executes commands\nfrom\n~/.bashrc\n, if that file exists and is readable.\nBash\ndoes\nnot read this file if invoked as\nsh\n.  The\n--norc\noption inhibits\nthis behavior, and the\n--rcfile\noption makes\nbash\nuse a different\nfile instead of\n~/.bashrc\n, but neither\nrshd\nnor\nsshd\ngenerally\ninvoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.\nIf the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not\nequal to the real user (group) id, and the\n-p\noption is not\nsupplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not\ninherited from the environment, the\nSHELLOPTS\n,\nBASHOPTS\n,\nCDPATH\n,\nand\nGLOBIGNORE\nvariables, if they appear in the environment, are\nignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user id.  If\nthe\n-p\noption is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is\nthe same, but the effective user id is not reset.\nDEFINITIONS\ntop\nThe following definitions are used throughout the rest of this\ndocument.\nblank\nA space or tab.\nwhitespace\nA character belonging to the\nspace\ncharacter class in the\ncurrent locale, or for which\nisspace(3)\nreturns true.\nword\nA sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the\nshell.  Also known as a\ntoken\n.\nname\nA\nword\nconsisting only of alphanumeric characters and\nunderscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or\nan underscore.  Also referred to as an\nidentifier\n.\nmetacharacter\nA character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of\nthe following:\n|  & ; ( ) < > space tab newline\ncontrol operator\nA\ntoken\nthat performs a control function.  It is one of the\nfollowing symbols:\n|| & && ; ;; ;& ;;& ( ) | |& <newline>\nRESERVED WORDS\ntop\nReserved words\nare words that have a special meaning to the shell.\nThe following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and\neither the first word of a command (see\nSHELL GRAMMAR\nbelow), the\nthird word of a\ncase\nor\nselect\ncommand (only\nin\nis valid), or the\nthird word of a\nfor\ncommand (only\nin\nand\ndo\nare valid):\n! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in\nselect then until while { } time [[ ]]\nSHELL GRAMMAR\ntop\nThis section describes the syntax of the various forms of shell\ncommands.\nSimple Commands\nA\nsimple command\nis a sequence of optional variable assignments\nfollowed by\nblank\n-separated words and redirections, and terminated\nby a\ncontrol operator\n.  The first word specifies the command to be\nexecuted, and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are\npassed as arguments to the invoked command.\nThe return value of a\nsimple command\nis its exit status, or 128+\nn\nif the command is terminated by signal\nn\n.\nPipelines\nA\npipeline\nis a sequence of one or more commands separated by one\nof the control operators\n|\nor\n|&\n.  The format for a pipeline is:\n[\ntime\n[\n-p\n]] [ ! ]\ncommand1\n[ [\n|\nâª\n|&\n]\ncommand2\n... ]\nThe standard output of\ncommand1\nis connected via a pipe to the\nstandard input of\ncommand2\n.  This connection is performed before\nany redirections specified by the\ncommand1\n(see\nREDIRECTION\nbelow).\nIf\n|&\nis the pipeline operator,\ncommand1\n's standard error, in\naddition to its standard output, is connected to\ncommand2\n's\nstandard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for\n2>&1 |\n.  This\nimplicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output\nis performed after any redirections specified by\ncommand1\n.\nThe return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last\ncommand, unless the\npipefail\noption is enabled.  If\npipefail\nis\nenabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last\n(rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all\ncommands exit successfully.  If the reserved word\n!\nprecedes a\npipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical negation\nof the exit status as described above.  If a pipeline is executed\nsynchronously, the shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to\nterminate before returning a value.\nIf the\ntime\nreserved word precedes a pipeline, the shell reports\nthe elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its\nexecution when the pipeline terminates.  The\n-p\noption changes the\noutput format to that specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in\nposix mode, it does not recognize\ntime\nas a reserved word if the\nnext token begins with a â-â.  The value of the\nTIMEFORMAT\nvariable is a format string that specifies how the timing\ninformation should be displayed; see the description of\nTIMEFORMAT\nbelow under\nShell Variables\n.\nWhen the shell is in posix mode,\ntime\nmay appear by itself as the\nonly word in a simple command.  In this case, the shell displays\nthe total user and system time consumed by the shell and its\nchildren.  The\nTIMEFORMAT\nvariable specifies the format of the\ntime information.\nEach command in a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are created,\nis executed in a\nsubshell\n, which is a separate process.  See\nCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT\nfor a description of subshells and a\nsubshell environment.  If the\nlastpipe\noption is enabled using the\nshopt\nbuiltin (see the description of\nshopt\nbelow), and job\ncontrol is not active, the last element of a pipeline may be run\nby the shell process.\nLists\nA\nlist\nis a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of\nthe operators\n;\n,\n&\n,\n&&\n, or\n||\n, and optionally terminated by one of\n;\n,\n&\n, or\n<newline>\n.\nOf these list operators,\n&&\nand\n||\nhave equal precedence, followed\nby\n;\nand\n&\n, which have equal precedence.\nA sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a\nlist\ninstead of\na semicolon to delimit commands.\nIf a command is terminated by the control operator\n&\n, the shell\nexecutes the command in the\nbackground\nin a subshell.  The shell\ndoes not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is\n0.  These are referred to as\nasynchronous\ncommands.  Commands\nseparated by a\n;\nare executed sequentially; the shell waits for\neach command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the exit\nstatus of the last command executed.\nAND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated\nby the\n&&\nand\n||\ncontrol operators, respectively.  AND and OR\nlists are executed with left associativity.  An AND list has the\nform\ncommand1\n&&\ncommand2\ncommand2\nis executed if, and only if,\ncommand1\nreturns an exit\nstatus of zero (success).\nAn OR list has the form\ncommand1\n||\ncommand2\ncommand2\nis executed if, and only if,\ncommand1\nreturns a non-zero\nexit status.  The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit\nstatus of the last command executed in the list.\nCompound Commands\nA\ncompound command\nis one of the following.  In most cases a\nlist\nin a command's description may be separated from the rest of the\ncommand by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline\nin place of a semicolon.\n(\nlist\n)\nlist\nis executed in a subshell (see\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\nENVIRONMENT\nbelow for a description of a subshell\nenvironment).  Variable assignments and builtin commands\nthat affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect\nafter the command completes.  The return status is the exit\nstatus of\nlist\n.\n{\nlist\n; }\nlist\nis executed in the current shell environment.\nlist\nmust be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is\nknown as a\ngroup command\n.  The return status is the exit\nstatus of\nlist\n.\nNote that unlike the metacharacters\n(\nand\n)\n,\n{\nand\n}\nare\nreserved words\nand must occur where a reserved word is\npermitted to be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word\nbreak, they must be separated from\nlist\nby whitespace or\nanother shell metacharacter.\n((\nexpression\n))\nThe arithmetic\nexpression\nis evaluated according to the\nrules described below under\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\n.  If the\nvalue of the expression is non-zero, the return status is\n0; otherwise the return status is 1.  The\nexpression\nundergoes the same expansions as if it were within double\nquotes, but unescaped double quote characters in\nexpression\nare not treated specially and are removed.  Since this can\npotentially result in empty strings, this command treats\nthose as expressions that evaluate to 0.\n[[\nexpression\n]]\nEvaluate the conditional expression\nexpression\nand return a\nstatus of zero (true) or non-zero (false).  Expressions are\ncomposed of the primaries described below under\nCONDITIONAL\nEXPRESSIONS\n.  The words between the\n[[\nand\n]]\ndo not\nundergo word splitting and pathname expansion.  The shell\nperforms tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,\narithmetic expansion, command substitution, process\nsubstitution, and quote removal on those words.\nConditional operators such as\n-f\nmust be unquoted to be\nrecognized as primaries.\nWhen used with\n[[\n, the\n<\nand\n>\noperators sort\nlexicographically using the current locale.\nWhen the\n==\nand\n!=\noperators are used, the string to the\nright of the operator is considered a pattern and matched\naccording to the rules described below under\nPattern\nMatching\n, as if the\nextglob\nshell option were enabled.  The\n=\noperator is equivalent to\n==\n.  If the\nnocasematch\nshell\noption is enabled, the match is performed without regard to\nthe case of alphabetic characters.  The return value is 0\nif the string matches (\n==\n) or does not match (\n!=\n) the\npattern, and 1 otherwise.  If any part of the pattern is\nquoted, the quoted portion is matched as a string: every\ncharacter in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of\nhaving any special pattern matching meaning.\nAn additional binary operator,\n=~\n, is available, with the\nsame precedence as\n==\nand\n!=\n.  When it is used, the string\nto the right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended\nregular expression and matched accordingly (using the POSIX\nregcomp\nand\nregexec\ninterfaces usually described in\nregex(3)\n).  The return value is 0 if the string matches the\npattern, and 1 otherwise.  If the regular expression is\nsyntactically incorrect, the conditional expression's\nreturn value is 2.  If the\nnocasematch\nshell option is\nenabled, the match is performed without regard to the case\nof alphabetic characters.\nIf any part of the pattern is quoted, the quoted portion is\nmatched literally, as above.  If the pattern is stored in a\nshell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the\nentire pattern to be matched literally.  Treat bracket\nexpressions in regular expressions carefully, since normal\nquoting and pattern characters lose their meanings between\nbrackets.\nThe match succeeds if the pattern matches any part of the\nstring.  Anchor the pattern using the\n^\nand\n$\nregular\nexpression operators to force it to match the entire\nstring.\nThe array variable\nBASH_REMATCH\nrecords which parts of the\nstring matched the pattern.  The element of\nBASH_REMATCH\nwith index 0 contains the portion of the string matching\nthe entire regular expression.  Substrings matched by\nparenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression\nare saved in the remaining\nBASH_REMATCH\nindices.  The\nelement of\nBASH_REMATCH\nwith index\nn\nis the portion of the\nstring matching the\nn\nth parenthesized subexpression.\nBash\nsets\nBASH_REMATCH\nin the global scope; declaring it as a\nlocal variable will lead to unexpected results.\nExpressions may be combined using the following operators,\nlisted in decreasing order of precedence:\n(\nexpression\n)\nReturns the value of\nexpression\n.  This may be used\nto override the normal precedence of operators.\n!\nexpression\nTrue if\nexpression\nis false.\nexpression1\n&&\nexpression2\nTrue if both\nexpression1\nand\nexpression2\nare true.\nexpression1\n||\nexpression2\nTrue if either\nexpression1\nor\nexpression2\nis true.\nThe\n&&\nand\n||\noperators do not evaluate\nexpression2\nif the\nvalue of\nexpression1\nis sufficient to determine the return\nvalue of the entire conditional expression.\nfor\nname\n[ [\nin\nword ...\n] ; ]\ndo\nlist\n;\ndone\nFirst, expand The list of words following\nin\n, generating a\nlist of items.  Then, the variable\nname\nis set to each\nelement of this list in turn, and\nlist\nis executed each\ntime.  If the\nin\nword\nis omitted, the\nfor\ncommand executes\nlist\nonce for each positional parameter that is set (see\nPARAMETERS\nbelow).  The return status is the exit status of\nthe last command that executes.  If the expansion of the\nitems following\nin\nresults in an empty list, no commands\nare executed, and the return status is 0.\nfor\n((\nexpr1\n;\nexpr2\n;\nexpr3\n)) [;]\ndo\nlist\n;\ndone\nFirst, evaluate the arithmetic expression\nexpr1\naccording\nto the rules described below under\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\n.\nThen, repeatedly evaluate the arithmetic expression\nexpr2\nuntil it evaluates to zero.  Each time\nexpr2\nevaluates to a\nnon-zero value, execute\nlist\nand evaluate the arithmetic\nexpression\nexpr3\n.  If any expression is omitted, it behaves\nas if it evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit\nstatus of the last command in\nlist\nthat is executed, or\nnon-zero if any of the expressions is invalid.\nUse the\nbreak\nand\ncontinue\nbuiltins (see\nSHELL BUILTIN\nCOMMANDS\nbelow) to control loop execution.\nselect\nname\n[\nin\nword\n] ;\ndo\nlist\n;\ndone\nFirst, expand the list of words following\nin\n, generating a\nlist of items, and print the set of expanded words the\nstandard error, each preceded by a number.  If the\nin\nword\nis omitted, print the positional parameters (see\nPARAMETERS\nbelow).\nselect\nthen displays the\nPS3\nprompt and reads a\nline from the standard input.  If the line consists of a\nnumber corresponding to one of the displayed words, then\nselect\nsets the value of\nname\nto that word.  If the line is\nempty,\nselect\ndisplays the words and prompt again.  If EOF\nis read,\nselect\ncompletes and returns 1.  Any other value\nsets\nname\nto null.  The line read is saved in the variable\nREPLY\n.  The\nlist\nis executed after each selection until a\nbreak\ncommand is executed.  The exit status of\nselect\nis\nthe exit status of the last command executed in\nlist\n, or\nzero if no commands were executed.\ncase\nword\nin\n[ [(]\npattern\n[\n|\npattern\n] ... )\nlist\n;; ] ...\nesac\nA\ncase\ncommand first expands\nword\n, and tries to match it\nagainst each\npattern\nin turn, proceeding from first to\nlast, using the matching rules described under\nPattern\nMatching\nbelow.  A pattern list is a set of one or more\npatterns separated by , and the ) operator terminates the\npattern list.  The\nword\nis expanded using tilde expansion,\nparameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,\ncommand substitution, process substitution and quote\nremoval.  Each\npattern\nexamined is expanded using tilde\nexpansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic\nexpansion, command substitution, process substitution, and\nquote removal.  If the\nnocasematch\nshell option is enabled,\nthe match is performed without regard to the case of\nalphabetic characters.  A\nclause\nis a pattern list and an\nassociated\nlist\n.\nWhen a match is found,\ncase\nexecutes the corresponding\nlist\n.  If the\n;;\noperator terminates the case clause, the\ncase\ncommand completes after the first match.  Using\n;&\nin\nplace of\n;;\ncauses execution to continue with the\nlist\nassociated with the next pattern list.  Using\n;;&\nin place\nof\n;;\ncauses the shell to test the next pattern list in the\nstatement, if any, and execute any associated\nlist\nif the\nmatch succeeds, continuing the case statement execution as\nif the pattern list had not matched.  The exit status is\nzero if no pattern matches.\nOtherwise, it is the exit status of the last command\nexecuted in the last\nlist\nexecuted.\nif\nlist\n;\nthen\nlist\n; [\nelif\nlist\n;\nthen\nlist\n; ] ... [\nelse\nlist\n; ]\nfi\nThe\nif\nlist\nis executed.  If its exit status is zero, the\nthen\nlist\nis executed.  Otherwise, each\nelif\nlist\nis\nexecuted in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the\ncorresponding\nthen\nlist\nis executed and the command\ncompletes.  Otherwise, the\nelse\nlist\nis executed, if\npresent.  The exit status is the exit status of the last\ncommand executed, or zero if no condition tested true.\nwhile\nlist-1\n;\ndo\nlist-2\n;\ndone\nuntil\nlist-1\n;\ndo\nlist-2\n;\ndone\nThe\nwhile\ncommand continuously executes the list\nlist-2\nas\nlong as the last command in the list\nlist-1\nreturns an exit\nstatus of zero.  The\nuntil\ncommand is identical to the\nwhile\ncommand, except that the test is negated:\nlist-2\nis\nexecuted as long as the last command in\nlist-1\nreturns a\nnon-zero exit status.  The exit status of the\nwhile\nand\nuntil\ncommands is the exit status of the last command\nexecuted in\nlist-2\n, or zero if none was executed.\nCoprocesses\nA\ncoprocess\nis a shell command preceded by the\ncoproc\nreserved\nword.  A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if\nthe command had been terminated with the\n&\ncontrol operator, with\na two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the\ncoprocess.\nThe syntax for a coprocess is:\ncoproc\n[\nNAME\n]\ncommand\n[\nredirections\n]\nThis creates a coprocess named\nNAME\n.\ncommand\nmay be either a\nsimple command or a compound command (see above).\nNAME\nis a shell\nvariable name.  If\nNAME\nis not supplied, the default name is\nCOPROC\n.\nThe recommended form to use for a coprocess is\ncoproc\nNAME\n{\ncommand\n[\nredirections\n]; }\nThis form is preferred because simple commands result in the\ncoprocess always being named\nCOPROC\n, and it is simpler to use and\nmore complete than the other compound commands.\nIf\ncommand\nis a compound command,\nNAME\nis optional. The word\nfollowing\ncoproc\ndetermines whether that word is interpreted as a\nvariable name: it is interpreted as\nNAME\nif it is not a reserved\nword that introduces a compound command.  If\ncommand\nis a simple\ncommand,\nNAME\nis not allowed; this is to avoid confusion between\nNAME\nand the first word of the simple command.\nWhen the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array\nvariable (see\nArrays\nbelow) named\nNAME\nin the context of the\nexecuting shell.  The standard output of\ncommand\nis connected via\na pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file\ndescriptor is assigned to\nNAME\n[0].  The standard input of\ncommand\nis connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing\nshell, and that file descriptor is assigned to\nNAME\n[1].  This pipe\nis established before any redirections specified by the command\n(see\nREDIRECTION\nbelow).  The file descriptors can be utilized as\narguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word\nexpansions.  Other than those created to execute command and\nprocess substitutions, the file descriptors are not available in\nsubshells.\nThe process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is\navailable as the value of the variable\nNAME\n_PID.  The\nwait\nbuiltin\nmay be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.\nSince the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the\ncoproc\ncommand always returns success.  The return status of a\ncoprocess is the exit status of\ncommand\n.\nShell Function Definitions\nA shell function is an object that is called like a simple command\nand executes a compound command with a new set of positional\nparameters.  Shell functions are declared as follows:\nfname\n()\ncompound-command\n[\nredirection\n]\nfunction\nfname\n[()]\ncompound-command\n[\nredirection\n]\nThis defines a function named\nfname\n.  The reserved word\nfunction\nis optional.  If the\nfunction\nreserved word is\nsupplied, the parentheses are optional.  The\nbody\nof the\nfunction is the compound command\ncompound-command\n(see\nCompound Commands\nabove).  That command is usually a\nlist\nof commands between { and }, but may be any command listed\nunder\nCompound Commands\nabove.  If the\nfunction\nreserved\nword is used, but the parentheses are not supplied, the\nbraces are recommended.\ncompound-command\nis executed\nwhenever\nfname\nis specified as the name of a simple\ncommand.  When in posix mode,\nfname\nmust be a valid shell\nname\nand may not be the name of one of the POSIX\nspecial\nbuiltins\n.  In default mode, a function name can be any\nunquoted shell word that does not contain\n$\n.\nAny redirections (see\nREDIRECTION\nbelow) specified when a function\nis defined are performed when the function is executed.\nThe exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax\nerror occurs or a readonly function with the same name already\nexists.  When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit\nstatus of the last command executed in the body.  (See\nFUNCTIONS\nbelow.)\nCOMMENTS\ntop\nIn a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the\ninteractive_comments\noption to the\nshopt\nbuiltin is enabled (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow), a word beginning with\n#\nintroduces\na comment.  A word begins at the beginning of a line, after\nunquoted whitespace, or after an operator.  The comment causes\nthat word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.\nAn interactive shell without the\ninteractive_comments\noption\nenabled does not allow comments.  The\ninteractive_comments\noption\nis enabled by default in interactive shells.\nQUOTING\ntop\nQuoting\nis used to remove the special meaning of certain\ncharacters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable\nspecial treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved\nwords from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter\nexpansion.\nEach of the\nmetacharacters\nlisted above under\nDEFINITIONS\nhas\nspecial meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to\nrepresent itself.\nWhen the command history expansion facilities are being used (see\nHISTORY EXPANSION\nbelow), the\nhistory expansion\ncharacter, usually\n!\n, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.\nThere are four quoting mechanisms: the\nescape character\n, single\nquotes, double quotes, and dollar-single quotes.\nA non-quoted backslash (\n\\\n) is the\nescape character\n.  It preserves\nthe literal value of the next character that follows, removing any\nspecial meaning it has, with the exception of <newline>.  If a\n\\\n<newline> pair appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted,\nthe\n\\\n<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is\nremoved from the input stream and effectively ignored).\nEnclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value\nof each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur\nbetween single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.\nEnclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value\nof all characters within the quotes, with the exception of\n$\n,\n`\n,\n\\\n, and, when history expansion is enabled,\n!\n.  When the shell is\nin posix mode, the\n!\nhas no special meaning within double quotes,\neven when history expansion is enabled.  The characters\n$\nand\n`\nretain their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash\nretains its special meaning only when followed by one of the\nfollowing characters:\n$\n,\n`\n,\n\"\n,\n\\\n, or\n<newline>\n.  Backslashes\npreceding characters without a special meaning are left\nunmodified.\nA double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it\nwith a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed\nunless an\n!\nappearing in double quotes is escaped using a\nbackslash.  The backslash preceding the\n!\nis not removed.\nThe special parameters\n*\nand\n@\nhave special meaning when in double\nquotes (see\nPARAMETERS\nbelow).\nCharacter sequences of the form\n$\n'\nstring\n' are treated as a special\nvariant of single quotes.  The sequence expands to\nstring\n, with\nbackslash-escaped characters in\nstring\nreplaced as specified by\nthe ANSI C standard.  Backslash escape sequences, if present, are\ndecoded as follows:\n\\a\nalert (bell)\n\\b\nbackspace\n\\e\n\\E\nan escape character\n\\f\nform feed\n\\n\nnew line\n\\r\ncarriage return\n\\t\nhorizontal tab\n\\v\nvertical tab\n\\\\\nbackslash\n\\'\nsingle quote\n\\\"\ndouble quote\n\\?\nquestion mark\n\\\nnnn\nThe eight-bit character whose value is the octal\nvalue\nnnn\n(one to three octal digits).\n\\x\nHH\nThe eight-bit character whose value is the\nhexadecimal value\nHH\n(one or two hex digits).\n\\u\nHHHH\nThe Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is\nthe hexadecimal value\nHHHH\n(one to four hex digits).\n\\U\nHHHHHHHH\nThe Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is\nthe hexadecimal value\nHHHHHHHH\n(one to eight hex\ndigits).\n\\c\nx\nA control-\nx\ncharacter.\nThe expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had\nnot been present.\nTranslating Strings\nA double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign (\n$\n\"\nstring\n\")\ncauses the string to be translated according to the current\nlocale.  The\ngettext\ninfrastructure performs the lookup and\ntranslation, using the\nLC_MESSAGES\n,\nTEXTDOMAINDIR\n, and\nTEXTDOMAIN\nshell variables.  If the current locale is\nC\nor\nPOSIX\n, if there\nare no translations available, or if the string is not translated,\nthe dollar sign is ignored, and the string is treated as double-\nquoted as described above.  This is a form of double quoting, so\nthe string remains double-quoted by default, whether or not it is\ntranslated and replaced.  If the\nnoexpand_translation\noption is\nenabled using the\nshopt\nbuiltin, translated strings are single-\nquoted instead of double-quoted.  See the description of\nshopt\nbelow under\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\n.\nPARAMETERS\ntop\nA\nparameter\nis an entity that stores values.  It can be a\nname\n, a\nnumber, or one of the special characters listed below under\nSpecial Parameters\n.  A\nvariable\nis a parameter denoted by a\nname\n.\nA variable has a\nvalue\nand zero or more\nattributes\n.  Attributes\nare assigned using the\ndeclare\nbuiltin command (see\ndeclare\nbelow\nin\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\n).  The\nexport\nand\nreadonly\nbuiltins\nassign specific attributes.\nA parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null\nstring is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset\nonly by using the\nunset\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN\nCOMMANDS\nbelow).\nA\nvariable\nis assigned to using a statement of the form\nname\n=[\nvalue\n]\nIf\nvalue\nis not given, the variable is assigned the null string.\nAll\nvalues\nundergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable\nexpansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote\nremoval (see\nEXPANSION\nbelow).  If the variable has its\ninteger\nattribute set, then\nvalue\nis evaluated as an arithmetic expression\neven if the\n$((\n...\n))\nexpansion is not used (see\nArithmetic\nExpansion\nbelow).  Word splitting and pathname expansion are not\nperformed.  Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to\nthe\nalias\n,\ndeclare\n,\ntypeset\n,\nexport\n,\nreadonly\n, and\nlocal\nbuiltin\ncommands (\ndeclaration\ncommands).  When in posix mode, these\nbuiltins may appear in a command after one or more instances of\nthe\ncommand\nbuiltin and retain these assignment statement\nproperties.\nIn the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value\nto a shell variable or array index, the â+=â operator appends to\nor adds to the variable's previous value.  This includes arguments\nto\ndeclaration\ncommands such as\ndeclare\nthat accept assignment\nstatements.  When â+=â is applied to a variable for which the\ninteger\nattribute has been set, the variable's current value and\nvalue\nare each evaluated as arithmetic expressions, and the sum of\nthe results is assigned as the variable's value.  The current\nvalue is usually an integer constant, but may be an expression.\nWhen â+=â is applied to an array variable using compound\nassignment (see\nArrays\nbelow), the variable's value is not unset\n(as it is when using â=â), and new values are appended to the\narray beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for\nindexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an\nassociative array.  When applied to a string-valued variable,\nvalue\nis expanded and appended to the variable's value.\nA variable can be assigned the\nnameref\nattribute using the\n-n\noption to the\ndeclare\nor\nlocal\nbuiltin commands (see the\ndescriptions of\ndeclare\nand\nlocal\nbelow) to create a\nnameref\n, or a\nreference to another variable.  This allows variables to be\nmanipulated indirectly.  Whenever the nameref variable is\nreferenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified\n(other than using or changing the\nnameref\nattribute itself), the\noperation is actually performed on the variable specified by the\nnameref variable's value.  A nameref is commonly used within shell\nfunctions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an\nargument to the function.  For instance, if a variable name is\npassed to a shell function as its first argument, running\ndeclare -n ref=$1\ninside the function creates a local nameref variable\nref\nwhose\nvalue is the variable name passed as the first argument.\nReferences and assignments to\nref\n, and changes to its attributes,\nare treated as references, assignments, and attribute\nmodifications to the variable whose name was passed as\n$1\n.  If the\ncontrol variable in a\nfor\nloop has the nameref attribute, the list\nof words can be a list of shell variables, and a name reference is\nestablished for each word in the list, in turn, when the loop is\nexecuted.  Array variables cannot be given the\nnameref\nattribute.\nHowever, nameref variables can reference array variables and\nsubscripted array variables.  Namerefs can be unset using the\n-n\noption to the\nunset\nbuiltin.  Otherwise, if\nunset\nis executed with\nthe name of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable\nreferenced by the nameref variable is unset.\nWhen the shell starts, it reads its environment and creates a\nshell variable from each environment variable that has a valid\nname, as described below (see\nENVIRONMENT\n).\nPositional Parameters\nA\npositional parameter\nis a parameter denoted by one or more\ndigits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are\nassigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be\nreassigned using the\nset\nbuiltin command.  Positional parameters\nmay not be assigned to with assignment statements.  The positional\nparameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is\nexecuted (see\nFUNCTIONS\nbelow).\nWhen a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit\nis expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see\nEXPANSION\nbelow).\nWithout braces, a digit following $ can only refer to one of the\nfirst nine positional parameters (\n$1-$9\n) or the special parameter\n$0\n(see the next section).\nSpecial Parameters\nThe shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters\nmay only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.\nSpecial parameters are denoted by one of the following characters.\n*\n(\n$*\n) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\none.  When the expansion is not within double quotes, each\npositional parameter expands to a separate word.  In\ncontexts where word expansions are performed, those words\nare subject to further word splitting and pathname\nexpansion.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes,\nit expands to a single word with the value of each\nparameter separated by the first character of the\nIFS\nvariable.  That is,\n\"$*\"\nis equivalent to\n\"$1\nc\n$2\nc\n...\"\n,\nwhere\nc\nis the first character of the value of the\nIFS\nvariable.  If\nIFS\nis unset, the parameters are separated by\nspaces.  If\nIFS\nis null, the parameters are joined without\nintervening separators.\n@\n(\n$@\n) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\none.  In contexts where word splitting is performed, this\nexpands each positional parameter to a separate word; if\nnot within double quotes, these words are subject to word\nsplitting.  In contexts where word splitting is not\nperformed, such as the value portion of an assignment\nstatement, this expands to a single word with each\npositional parameter separated by a space.  When the\nexpansion occurs within double quotes, and word splitting\nis performed, each parameter expands to a separate word.\nThat is,\n\"$@\"\nis equivalent to\n\"$1\" \"$2\" ...\nIf the\ndouble-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion\nof the first parameter is joined with the expansion of the\nbeginning part of the original word, and the expansion of\nthe last parameter is joined with the expansion of the last\npart of the original word.  When there are no positional\nparameters,\n\"$@\"\nand\n$@\nexpand to nothing (i.e., they are\nremoved).\n#\n(\n$#\n) Expands to the number of positional parameters in\ndecimal.\n?\n(\n$?\n) Expands to the exit status of the most recently\nexecuted command.\n-\n(\n$-\n) Expands to the current option flags as specified upon\ninvocation, by the\nset\nbuiltin command, or those set by the\nshell itself (such as the\n-i\noption).\n$\n(\n$$\n) Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a\nsubshell, it expands to the process ID of the parent shell,\nnot the subshell.\n!\n(\n$!\n)Expands to the process ID of the job most recently\nplaced into the background, whether executed as an\nasynchronous command or using the\nbg\nbuiltin (see\nJOB\nCONTROL\nbelow).\n0\n(\n$0\n) Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.\nThis is set at shell initialization.  If\nbash\nis invoked\nwith a file of commands,\n$0\nis set to the name of that\nfile.  If\nbash\nis started with the\n-c\noption, then\n$0\nis\nset to the first argument after the string to be executed,\nif one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to the filename\nused to invoke\nbash\n, as given by argument zero.\nShell Variables\nThe shell sets following variables:\n_\n(\n$_\n, an underscore) This has a number of meanings depending\non context.  At shell startup,\n_\nis set to the pathname\nused to invoke the shell or shell script being executed as\npassed in the environment or argument list.  Subsequently,\nit expands to the last argument to the previous simple\ncommand executed in the foreground, after expansion.  It is\nalso set to the full pathname used to invoke each command\nexecuted and placed in the environment exported to that\ncommand.  When checking mail,\n$_\nexpands to the name of the\nmail file currently being checked.\nBASH\nExpands to the full filename used to invoke this instance\nof\nbash\n.\nBASHOPTS\nA colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word\nin the list is a valid argument for the\n-s\noption to the\nshopt\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nThe options appearing in\nBASHOPTS\nare those reported as\non\nby\nshopt\n.  If this variable is in the environment when\nbash\nstarts up, the shell enables each option in the list before\nreading any startup files.  If this variable is exported,\nchild shells will enable each option in the list.  This\nvariable is read-only.\nBASHPID\nExpands to the process ID of the current\nbash\nprocess.\nThis differs from\n$$\nunder certain circumstances, such as\nsubshells that do not require\nbash\nto be re-initialized.\nAssignments to\nBASHPID\nhave no effect.  If\nBASHPID\nis\nunset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nBASH_ALIASES\nAn associative array variable whose members correspond to\nthe internal list of aliases as maintained by the\nalias\nbuiltin.  Elements added to this array appear in the alias\nlist; however, unsetting array elements currently does not\nremove aliases from the alias list.  If\nBASH_ALIASES\nis\nunset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nBASH_ARGC\nAn array variable whose values are the number of parameters\nin each frame of the current\nbash\nexecution call stack.\nThe number of parameters to the current subroutine (shell\nfunction or script executed with\n.\nor\nsource\n) is at the top\nof the stack.  When a subroutine is executed, the number of\nparameters passed is pushed onto\nBASH_ARGC\n.  The shell sets\nBASH_ARGC\nonly when in extended debugging mode (see the\ndescription of the\nextdebug\noption to the\nshopt\nbuiltin\nbelow).  Setting\nextdebug\nafter the shell has started to\nexecute a script, or referencing this variable when\nextdebug\nis not set, may result in inconsistent values.\nAssignments to\nBASH_ARGC\nhave no effect, and it may not be\nunset.\nBASH_ARGV\nAn array variable containing all of the parameters in the\ncurrent\nbash\nexecution call stack.  The final parameter of\nthe last subroutine call is at the top of the stack; the\nfirst parameter of the initial call is at the bottom.  When\na subroutine is executed, the shell pushes the supplied\nparameters onto\nBASH_ARGV\n.  The shell sets\nBASH_ARGV\nonly\nwhen in extended debugging mode (see the description of the\nextdebug\noption to the\nshopt\nbuiltin below).  Setting\nextdebug\nafter the shell has started to execute a script,\nor referencing this variable when\nextdebug\nis not set, may\nresult in inconsistent values.  Assignments to\nBASH_ARGV\nhave no effect, and it may not be unset.\nBASH_ARGV0\nWhen referenced, this variable expands to the name of the\nshell or shell script (identical to\n$0\n; see the description\nof special parameter 0 above).  Assigning a value to\nBASH_ARGV0\nsets\n$0\nto the same value.  If\nBASH_ARGV0\nis\nunset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nBASH_CMDS\nAn associative array variable whose members correspond to\nthe internal hash table of commands as maintained by the\nhash\nbuiltin.  Adding elements to this array makes them\nappear in the hash table; however, unsetting array elements\ncurrently does not remove command names from the hash\ntable.  If\nBASH_CMDS\nis unset, it loses its special\nproperties, even if it is subsequently reset.\nBASH_COMMAND\nExpands to the command currently being executed or about to\nbe executed, unless the shell is executing a command as the\nresult of a trap, in which case it is the command executing\nat the time of the trap.  If\nBASH_COMMAND\nis unset, it\nloses its special properties, even if it is subsequently\nreset.\nBASH_EXECUTION_STRING\nThe command argument to the\n-c\ninvocation option.\nBASH_LINENO\nAn array variable whose members are the line numbers in\nsource files where each corresponding member of\nFUNCNAME\nwas invoked.\n${BASH_LINENO[\n$i\n]}\nis the line number in the\nsource file (\n${BASH_SOURCE[\n$i+1\n]}\n) where\n${FUNCNAME[\n$i\n]}\nwas called (or\n${BASH_LINENO[\n$i-1\n]}\nif referenced within\nanother shell function).  Use\nLINENO\nto obtain the current\nline number.  Assignments to\nBASH_LINENO\nhave no effect,\nand it may not be unset.\nBASH_LOADABLES_PATH\nA colon-separated list of directories in which the\nenable\ncommand looks for dynamically loadable builtins.\nBASH_MONOSECONDS\nEach time this variable is referenced, it expands to the\nvalue returned by the system's monotonic clock, if one is\navailable.  If there is no monotonic clock, this is\nequivalent to\nEPOCHSECONDS\n.  If\nBASH_MONOSECONDS\nis unset,\nit loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently\nreset.\nBASH_REMATCH\nAn array variable whose members are assigned by the\n=~\nbinary operator to the\n[[\nconditional command.  The element\nwith index 0 is the portion of the string matching the\nentire regular expression.  The element with index\nn\nis the\nportion of the string matching the\nn\nth parenthesized\nsubexpression.\nBASH_SOURCE\nAn array variable whose members are the source filenames\nwhere the corresponding shell function names in the\nFUNCNAME\narray variable are defined.  The shell function\n${FUNCNAME[\n$i\n]}\nis defined in the file\n${BASH_SOURCE[\n$i\n]}\nand called from\n${BASH_SOURCE[\n$i+1\n]}\n.  Assignments to\nBASH_SOURCE\nhave no effect, and it may not be unset.\nBASH_SUBSHELL\nIncremented by one within each subshell or subshell\nenvironment when the shell begins executing in that\nenvironment.  The initial value is 0.  If\nBASH_SUBSHELL\nis\nunset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nBASH_TRAPSIG\nSet to the signal number corresponding to the trap action\nbeing executed during its execution.  See the description\nof\ntrap\nunder\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow for information\nabout signal numbers and trap execution.\nBASH_VERSINFO\nA readonly array variable whose members hold version\ninformation for this instance of\nbash\n.  The values assigned\nto the array members are as follows:\nBASH_VERSINFO[\n0\n]\nThe major version number (the\nrelease\n).\nBASH_VERSINFO[\n1\n]\nThe minor version number (the\nversion\n).\nBASH_VERSINFO[\n2\n]\nThe patch level.\nBASH_VERSINFO[\n3\n]\nThe build version.\nBASH_VERSINFO[\n4\n]\nThe release status (e.g.,\nbeta\n).\nBASH_VERSINFO[\n5\n]\nThe value of\nMACHTYPE\n.\nBASH_VERSION\nExpands to a string describing the version of this instance\nof\nbash\n(e.g., 5.2.37(3)-release).\nCOMP_CWORD\nAn index into\n${COMP_WORDS}\nof the word containing the\ncurrent cursor position.  This variable is available only\nin shell functions invoked by the programmable completion\nfacilities (see\nProgrammable Completion\nbelow).\nCOMP_KEY\nThe key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the\ncurrent completion function.  This variable is available\nonly in shell functions and external commands invoked by\nthe programmable completion facilities (see\nProgrammable\nCompletion\nbelow).\nCOMP_LINE\nThe current command line.  This variable is available only\nin shell functions and external commands invoked by the\nprogrammable completion facilities (see\nProgrammable\nCompletion\nbelow).\nCOMP_POINT\nThe index of the current cursor position relative to the\nbeginning of the current command.  If the current cursor\nposition is at the end of the current command, the value of\nthis variable is equal to\n${#COMP_LINE}\n.  This variable is\navailable only in shell functions and external commands\ninvoked by the programmable completion facilities (see\nProgrammable Completion\nbelow).\nCOMP_TYPE\nSet to an integer value corresponding to the type of\nattempted completion that caused a completion function to\nbe called:\nTAB\n, for normal completion,\n?\n, for listing\ncompletions after successive tabs,\n!\n, for listing\nalternatives on partial word completion,\n@\n, to list\ncompletions if the word is not unmodified, or\n%\n, for menu\ncompletion.  This variable is available only in shell\nfunctions and external commands invoked by the programmable\ncompletion facilities (see\nProgrammable Completion\nbelow).\nCOMP_WORDBREAKS\nThe set of characters that the\nreadline\nlibrary treats as\nword separators when performing word completion.  If\nCOMP_WORDBREAKS\nis unset, it loses its special properties,\neven if it is subsequently reset.\nCOMP_WORDS\nAn array variable (see\nArrays\nbelow) consisting of the\nindividual words in the current command line.  The line is\nsplit into words as\nreadline\nwould split it, using\nCOMP_WORDBREAKS\nas described above.  This variable is\navailable only in shell functions invoked by the\nprogrammable completion facilities (see\nProgrammable\nCompletion\nbelow).\nCOPROC\nAn array variable (see\nArrays\nbelow) created to hold the\nfile descriptors for output from and input to an unnamed\ncoprocess (see\nCoprocesses\nabove).\nDIRSTACK\nAn array variable (see\nArrays\nbelow) containing the current\ncontents of the directory stack.  Directories appear in the\nstack in the order they are displayed by the\ndirs\nbuiltin.\nAssigning to members of this array variable may be used to\nmodify directories already in the stack, but the\npushd\nand\npopd\nbuiltins must be used to add and remove directories.\nAssigning to this variable does not change the current\ndirectory.  If\nDIRSTACK\nis unset, it loses its special\nproperties, even if it is subsequently reset.\nEPOCHREALTIME\nEach time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the\nnumber of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see\ntime\n(3)) as a\nfloating-point value with micro-second granularity.\nAssignments to\nEPOCHREALTIME\nare ignored.  If\nEPOCHREALTIME\nis unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nEPOCHSECONDS\nEach time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the\nnumber of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see\ntime\n(3)).\nAssignments to\nEPOCHSECONDS\nare ignored.  If\nEPOCHSECONDS\nis unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nEUID\nExpands to the effective user ID of the current user,\ninitialized at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.\nFUNCNAME\nAn array variable containing the names of all shell\nfunctions currently in the execution call stack.  The\nelement with index 0 is the name of any currently-executing\nshell function.  The bottom-most element (the one with the\nhighest index) is âmainâ.  This variable exists only when a\nshell function is executing.  Assignments to\nFUNCNAME\nhave\nno effect.  If\nFUNCNAME\nis unset, it loses its special\nproperties, even if it is subsequently reset.\nThis variable can be used with\nBASH_LINENO\nand\nBASH_SOURCE\n.\nEach element of\nFUNCNAME\nhas corresponding elements in\nBASH_LINENO\nand\nBASH_SOURCE\nto describe the call stack.\nFor instance,\n${FUNCNAME[\n$i\n]}\nwas called from the file\n${BASH_SOURCE[\n$i+1\n]}\nat line number\n${BASH_LINENO[\n$i\n]}\n.\nThe\ncaller\nbuiltin displays the current call stack using\nthis information.\nGROUPS\nAn array variable containing the list of groups of which\nthe current user is a member.  Assignments to\nGROUPS\nhave\nno effect.  If\nGROUPS\nis unset, it loses its special\nproperties, even if it is subsequently reset.\nHISTCMD\nThe history number, or index in the history list, of the\ncurrent command.  Assignments to\nHISTCMD\nhave no effect.\nIf\nHISTCMD\nis unset, it loses its special properties, even\nif it is subsequently reset.\nHOSTNAME\nAutomatically set to the name of the current host.\nHOSTTYPE\nAutomatically set to a string that uniquely describes the\ntype of machine on which\nbash\nis executing.  The default is\nsystem-dependent.\nLINENO\nEach time this parameter is referenced, the shell\nsubstitutes a decimal number representing the current\nsequential line number (starting with 1) within a script or\nfunction.  When not in a script or function, the value\nsubstituted is not guaranteed to be meaningful.  If\nLINENO\nis unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nMACHTYPE\nAutomatically set to a string that fully describes the\nsystem type on which\nbash\nis executing, in the standard GNU\ncpu-company-system\nformat.  The default is system-\ndependent.\nMAPFILE\nAn array variable (see\nArrays\nbelow) created to hold the\ntext read by the\nmapfile\nbuiltin when no variable name is\nsupplied.\nOLDPWD\nThe previous working directory as set by the\ncd\ncommand.\nOPTARG\nThe value of the last option argument processed by the\ngetopts\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nOPTIND\nThe index of the next argument to be processed by the\ngetopts\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nOSTYPE\nAutomatically set to a string that describes the operating\nsystem on which\nbash\nis executing.  The default is system-\ndependent.\nPIPESTATUS\nAn array variable (see\nArrays\nbelow) containing a list of\nexit status values from the commands in the most-recently-\nexecuted foreground pipeline, which may consist of only a\nsimple command (see\nSHELL GRAMMAR\nabove).\nBash\nsets\nPIPESTATUS\nafter executing multi-element pipelines, timed\nand negated pipelines, simple commands, subshells created\nwith the ( operator, the\n[[\nand\n((\ncompound commands, and\nafter error conditions that result in the shell aborting\ncommand execution.\nPPID\nThe process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is\nreadonly.\nPWD\nThe current working directory as set by the\ncd\ncommand.\nRANDOM\nEach time this parameter is referenced, it expands to a\nrandom integer between 0 and 32767.  Assigning a value to\nRANDOM\ninitializes (seeds) the sequence of random numbers.\nSeeding the random number generator with the same constant\nvalue produces the same sequence of values.  If\nRANDOM\nis\nunset, it loses its special properties, even if it is\nsubsequently reset.\nREADLINE_ARGUMENT\nAny numeric argument given to a\nreadline\ncommand that was\ndefined using âbind -xâ (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow)\nwhen it was invoked.\nREADLINE_LINE\nThe contents of the\nreadline\nline buffer, for use with\nâbind -xâ (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nREADLINE_MARK\nThe position of the mark (saved insertion point) in the\nreadline\nline buffer, for use with âbind -xâ (see\nSHELL\nBUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).  The characters between the\ninsertion point and the mark are often called the\nregion\n.\nREADLINE_POINT\nThe position of the insertion point in the\nreadline\nline\nbuffer, for use with âbind -xâ (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nREPLY\nSet to the line of input read by the\nread\nbuiltin command\nwhen no arguments are supplied.\nSECONDS\nEach time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the\nnumber of seconds since shell invocation.  If a value is\nassigned to\nSECONDS\n, the value returned upon subsequent\nreferences is the number of seconds since the assignment\nplus the value assigned.  The number of seconds at shell\ninvocation and the current time are always determined by\nquerying the system clock at one-second resolution.  If\nSECONDS\nis unset, it loses its special properties, even if\nit is subsequently reset.\nSHELLOPTS\nA colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word\nin the list is a valid argument for the\n-o\noption to the\nset\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nThe options appearing in\nSHELLOPTS\nare those reported as\non\nby\nset -o\n.  If this variable is in the environment when\nbash\nstarts up, the shell enables each option in the list\nbefore reading any startup files.  If this variable is\nexported, child shells will enable each option in the list.\nThis variable is read-only.\nSHLVL\nIncremented by one each time an instance of\nbash\nis\nstarted.\nSRANDOM\nEach time it is referenced, this variable expands to a\n32-bit pseudo-random number.  The random number generator\nis not linear on systems that support\n/dev/urandom\nor\narc4random(3)\n, so each returned number has no relationship\nto the numbers preceding it.  The random number generator\ncannot be seeded, so assignments to this variable have no\neffect.  If\nSRANDOM\nis unset, it loses its special\nproperties, even if it is subsequently reset.\nUID\nExpands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at\nshell startup.  This variable is readonly.\nThe shell uses the following variables. In some cases,\nbash\nassigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted\nbelow.\nBASH_COMPAT\nThe value is used to set the shell's compatibility level.\nSee\nSHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE\nbelow for a description of the\nvarious compatibility levels and their effects.  The value\nmay be a decimal number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g.,\n42) corresponding to the desired compatibility level.  If\nBASH_COMPAT\nis unset or set to the empty string, the\ncompatibility level is set to the default for the current\nversion.  If\nBASH_COMPAT\nis set to a value that is not one\nof the valid compatibility levels, the shell prints an\nerror message and sets the compatibility level to the\ndefault for the current version.  A subset of the valid\nvalues correspond to the compatibility levels described\nbelow under\nSHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE\n.  For example, 4.2 and\n42 are valid values that correspond to the\ncompat42 shopt\noption and set the compatibility level to 42.  The current\nversion is also a valid value.\nBASH_ENV\nIf this parameter is set when\nbash\nis executing a shell\nscript, its expanded value is interpreted as a filename\ncontaining commands to initialize the shell before it reads\nand executes commands from the script.  The value of\nBASH_ENV\nis subjected to parameter expansion, command\nsubstitution, and arithmetic expansion before being\ninterpreted as a filename.\nPATH\nis not used to search for\nthe resultant filename.\nBASH_XTRACEFD\nIf set to an integer corresponding to a valid file\ndescriptor,\nbash\nwrites the trace output generated when\nâset -xâ is enabled to that file descriptor, instead of the\nstandard error.  The file descriptor is closed when\nBASH_XTRACEFD\nis unset or assigned a new value.  Unsetting\nBASH_XTRACEFD\nor assigning it the empty string causes the\ntrace output to be sent to the standard error.  Note that\nsetting\nBASH_XTRACEFD\nto 2 (the standard error file\ndescriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the\nstandard error being closed.\nCDPATH\nThe search path for the\ncd\ncommand.  This is a colon-\nseparated list of directories where the shell looks for\ndirectories specified as arguments to the\ncd\ncommand.  A\nsample value is â.:~:/usrâ.\nCHILD_MAX\nSet the number of exited child status values for the shell\nto remember.\nBash\nwill not allow this value to be\ndecreased below a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a\nmaximum value (currently 8192) that this may not exceed.\nThe minimum value is system-dependent.\nCOLUMNS\nUsed by the\nselect\ncompound command to determine the\nterminal width when printing selection lists.\nAutomatically set if the\ncheckwinsize\noption is enabled or\nin an interactive shell upon receipt of a\nSIGWINCH\n.\nCOMPREPLY\nAn array variable from which\nbash\nreads the possible\ncompletions generated by a shell function invoked by the\nprogrammable completion facility (see\nProgrammable\nCompletion\nbelow).  Each array element contains one\npossible completion.\nEMACS\nIf\nbash\nfinds this variable in the environment when the\nshell starts with value âtâ, it assumes that the shell is\nrunning in an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.\nENV\nExpanded and executed similarly to\nBASH_ENV\n(see\nINVOCATION\nabove) when an interactive shell is invoked in posix mode.\nEXECIGNORE\nA colon-separated list of shell patterns (see\nPattern\nMatching\n) defining the set of filenames to be ignored by\ncommand search using\nPATH\n.  Files whose full pathnames\nmatch one of these patterns are not considered executable\nfiles for the purposes of completion and command execution\nvia\nPATH\nlookup.  This does not affect the behavior of the\n[\n,\ntest\n, and\n[[\ncommands.  Full pathnames in the command\nhash table are not subject to\nEXECIGNORE\n.  Use this\nvariable to ignore shared library files that have the\nexecutable bit set, but are not executable files.  The\npattern matching honors the setting of the\nextglob\nshell\noption.\nFCEDIT\nThe default editor for the\nfc\nbuiltin command.\nFIGNORE\nA colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when\nperforming filename completion (see\nREADLINE\nbelow).  A\nfilename whose suffix matches one of the entries in\nFIGNORE\nis excluded from the list of matched filenames.  A sample\nvalue is â.o:~â.\nFUNCNEST\nIf set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum\nfunction nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed\nthis nesting level cause the current command to abort.\nGLOBIGNORE\nA colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of file\nnames to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a file name\nmatched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of\nthe patterns in\nGLOBIGNORE\n, it is removed from the list of\nmatches.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the\nextglob\nshell option.\nGLOBSORT\nControls how the results of pathname expansion are sorted.\nThe value of this variable specifies the sort criteria and\nsort order for the results of pathname expansion.  If this\nvariable is unset or set to the null string, pathname\nexpansion uses the historical behavior of sorting by name,\nin ascending lexicographic order as determined by the\nLC_COLLATE\nshell variable.\nIf set, a valid value begins with an optional\n+\n, which is\nignored, or\n-\n, which reverses the sort order from ascending\nto descending, followed by a sort specifier.  The valid\nsort specifiers are\nname\n,\nnumeric\n,\nsize\n,\nmtime\n,\natime\n,\nctime\n, and\nblocks\n, which sort the files on name, names in\nnumeric rather than lexicographic order, file size,\nmodification time, access time, inode change time, and\nnumber of blocks, respectively.  If any of the non-name\nkeys compare as equal (e.g., if two files are the same\nsize), sorting uses the name as a secondary sort key.\nFor example, a value of\n-mtime\nsorts the results in\ndescending order by modification time (newest first).\nThe\nnumeric\nspecifier treats names consisting solely of\ndigits as numbers and sorts them using their numeric value\n(so â2â sorts before â10â, for example).  When using\nnumeric\n, names containing non-digits sort after all the\nall-digit names and are sorted by name using the\ntraditional behavior.\nA sort specifier of\nnosort\ndisables sorting completely;\nbash\nreturns the results in the order they are read from\nthe file system, ignoring any leading\n-\n.\nIf the sort specifier is missing, it defaults to\nname\n, so a\nvalue of\n+\nis equivalent to the null string, and a value of\n-\nsorts by name in descending order.  Any invalid value\nrestores the historical sorting behavior.\nHISTCONTROL\nA colon-separated list of values controlling how commands\nare saved on the history list.  If the list of values\nincludes\nignorespace\n, lines which begin with a\nspace\ncharacter are not saved in the history list.  A value of\nignoredups\ncauses lines matching the previous history entry\nnot to be saved.  A value of\nignoreboth\nis shorthand for\nignorespace\nand\nignoredups\n.  A value of\nerasedups\ncauses\nall previous lines matching the current line to be removed\nfrom the history list before that line is saved.  Any value\nnot in the above list is ignored.  If\nHISTCONTROL\nis unset,\nor does not include a valid value,\nbash\nsaves all lines\nread by the shell parser on the history list, subject to\nthe value of\nHISTIGNORE\n.  If the first line of a multi-line\ncompound command was saved, the second and subsequent lines\nare not tested, and are added to the history regardless of\nthe value of\nHISTCONTROL\n.  If the first line was not saved,\nthe second and subsequent lines of the command are not\nsaved either.\nHISTFILE\nThe name of the file in which command history is saved (see\nHISTORY\nbelow).\nBash\nassigns a default value of\n~/.bash_history\n.  If\nHISTFILE\nis unset or null, the shell\ndoes not save the command history when it exits.\nHISTFILESIZE\nThe maximum number of lines contained in the history file.\nWhen this variable is assigned a value, the history file is\ntruncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number\nof history entries that total no more than that number of\nlines by removing the oldest entries.  If the history list\ncontains multi-line entries, the history file may contain\nmore lines than this maximum to avoid leaving partial\nhistory entries.  The history file is also truncated to\nthis size after writing it when a shell exits or by the\nhistory\nbuiltin.  If the value is 0, the history file is\ntruncated to zero size.  Non-numeric values and numeric\nvalues less than zero inhibit truncation.  The shell sets\nthe default value to the value of\nHISTSIZE\nafter reading\nany startup files.\nHISTIGNORE\nA colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which\ncommand lines should be saved on the history list.  If a\ncommand line matches one of the patterns in the value of\nHISTIGNORE\n, it is not saved on the history list.  Each\npattern is anchored at the beginning of the line and must\nmatch the complete line (\nbash\ndoes not  implicitly append a\nâ\n*\nâ).  Each pattern is tested against the line after the\nchecks specified by\nHISTCONTROL\nare applied.  In addition\nto the normal shell pattern matching characters, â\n&\nâ\nmatches the previous history line.  A backslash escapes the\nâ\n&\nâ; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.\nIf the first line of a multi-line compound command was\nsaved, the second and subsequent lines are not tested, and\nare added to the history regardless of the value of\nHISTIGNORE\n.  If the first line was not saved, the second\nand subsequent lines of the command are not saved either.\nThe pattern matching honors the setting of the\nextglob\nshell option.\nHISTIGNORE\nsubsumes some of the function of\nHISTCONTROL\n.  A\npattern of â&â is identical to âignoredupsâ, and a pattern\nof â[ ]*â is identical to âignorespaceâ.  Combining these\ntwo patterns, separating them with a colon, provides the\nfunctionality of âignorebothâ.\nHISTSIZE\nThe number of commands to remember in the command history\n(see\nHISTORY\nbelow).  If the value is 0, commands are not\nsaved in the history list.  Numeric values less than zero\nresult in every command being saved on the history list\n(there is no limit).  The shell sets the default value to\n500 after reading any startup files.\nHISTTIMEFORMAT\nIf this variable is set and not null, its value is used as\na format string for\nstrftime(3)\nto print the time stamp\nassociated with each history entry displayed by the\nhistory\nbuiltin.  If this variable is set, the shell writes time\nstamps to the history file so they may be preserved across\nshell sessions.  This uses the history comment character to\ndistinguish timestamps from other history lines.\nHOME\nThe home directory of the current user; the default\nargument for the\ncd\nbuiltin command.  The value of this\nvariable is also used when performing tilde expansion.\nHOSTFILE\nContains the name of a file in the same format as\n/etc/hosts\nthat should be read when the shell needs to\ncomplete a hostname.  The list of possible hostname\ncompletions may be changed while the shell is running; the\nnext time hostname completion is attempted after the value\nis changed,\nbash\nadds the contents of the new file to the\nexisting list.  If\nHOSTFILE\nis set, but has no value, or\ndoes not name a readable file,\nbash\nattempts to read\n/etc/hosts\nto obtain the list of possible hostname\ncompletions.  When\nHOSTFILE\nis unset,\nbash\nclears the\nhostname list.\nIFS\nThe\nInternal Field Separator\nthat is used for word\nsplitting after expansion and to split lines into words\nwith the\nread\nbuiltin command.  Word splitting is described\nbelow under\nEXPANSION\n.  The default value is\nâ<space><tab><newline>â.\nIGNOREEOF\nControls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of\nan\nEOF\ncharacter as the sole input.  If set, the value is\nthe number of consecutive\nEOF\ncharacters which must be\ntyped as the first characters on an input line before\nbash\nexits.  If the variable is set but does not have a numeric\nvalue, or the value is null, the default value is 10.  If\nit is unset,\nEOF\nsignifies the end of input to the shell.\nINPUTRC\nThe filename for the\nreadline\nstartup file, overriding the\ndefault of\n~/.inputrc\n(see\nREADLINE\nbelow).\nINSIDE_EMACS\nIf this variable appears in the environment when the shell\nstarts,\nbash\nassumes that it is running inside an Emacs\nshell buffer and may disable line editing, depending on the\nvalue of\nTERM\n.\nLANG\nUsed to determine the locale category for any category not\nspecifically selected with a variable starting with\nLC_\n.\nLC_ALL\nThis variable overrides the value of\nLANG\nand any other\nLC_\nvariable specifying a locale category.\nLC_COLLATE\nThis variable determines the collation order used when\nsorting the results of pathname expansion, and determines\nthe behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes, and\ncollating sequences within pathname expansion and pattern\nmatching.\nLC_CTYPE\nThis variable determines the interpretation of characters\nand the behavior of character classes within pathname\nexpansion and pattern matching.\nLC_MESSAGES\nThis variable determines the locale used to translate\ndouble-quoted strings preceded by a\n$\n.\nLC_NUMERIC\nThis variable determines the locale category used for\nnumber formatting.\nLC_TIME\nThis variable determines the locale category used for data\nand time formatting.\nLINES\nUsed by the\nselect\ncompound command to determine the column\nlength for printing selection lists.  Automatically set if\nthe\ncheckwinsize\noption is enabled or in an interactive\nshell upon receipt of a\nSIGWINCH\n.\nMAIL\nIf the value is set to a file or directory name and the\nMAILPATH\nvariable is not set,\nbash\ninforms the user of the\narrival of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format\ndirectory.\nMAILCHECK\nSpecifies how often (in seconds)\nbash\nchecks for mail.  The\ndefault is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail,\nthe shell does so before displaying the primary prompt.  If\nthis variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a\nnumber greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables\nmail checking.\nMAILPATH\nA colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail.\nThe message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular\nfile may be specified by separating the filename from the\nmessage with a â?â.  When used in the text of the message,\n$_\nexpands to the name of the current mailfile.  For\nexample:\nMAILPATH\n='/var/mail/bfox?\"You have mail\":~/shell-mail?\"$_ has mail!\"'\nBash\ncan be configured to supply a default value for this\nvariable (there is no value by default), but the location\nof the user mail files that it uses is system dependent\n(e.g., /var/mail/\n$USER\n).\nOPTERR\nIf set to the value 1,\nbash\ndisplays error messages\ngenerated by the\ngetopts\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN\nCOMMANDS\nbelow).\nOPTERR\nis initialized to 1 each time the\nshell is invoked or a shell script is executed.\nPATH\nThe search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list\nof directories in which the shell looks for commands (see\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\nbelow).  A zero-length (null) directory\nname in the value of\nPATH\nindicates the current directory.\nA null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or\nas an initial or trailing colon.  The default path is\nsystem-dependent, and is set by the administrator who\ninstalls\nbash\n.  A common value is\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:\n/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nIf this variable is in the environment when\nbash\nstarts,\nthe shell enters posix mode before reading the startup\nfiles, as if the\n--posix\ninvocation option had been\nsupplied.  If it is set while the shell is running,\nbash\nenables posix mode, as if the command âset -o posixâ had\nbeen executed.  When the shell enters posix mode, it sets\nthis variable if it was not already set.\nPROMPT_COMMAND\nIf this variable is set, and is an array, the value of each\nset element is executed as a command prior to issuing each\nprimary prompt.  If this is set but not an array variable,\nits value is used as a command to execute instead.\nPROMPT_DIRTRIM\nIf set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as\nthe number of trailing directory components to retain when\nexpanding the\n\\w\nand\n\\W\nprompt string escapes (see\nPROMPTING\nbelow).  Characters removed are replaced with an\nellipsis.\nPS0\nThe value of this parameter is expanded (see\nPROMPTING\nbelow) and displayed by interactive shells after reading a\ncommand and before the command is executed.\nPS1\nThe value of this parameter is expanded (see\nPROMPTING\nbelow) and used as the primary prompt string.  The default\nvalue is â\\s-\\v\\$ â.\nPS2\nThe value of this parameter is expanded as with\nPS1\nand\nused as the secondary prompt string.  The default is â> â.\nPS3\nThe value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the\nselect\ncommand (see\nSHELL GRAMMAR\nabove).\nPS4\nThe value of this parameter is expanded as with\nPS1\nand the\nvalue is printed before each command\nbash\ndisplays during\nan execution trace.  The first character of the expanded\nvalue of\nPS4\nis replicated multiple times, as necessary, to\nindicate multiple levels of indirection.  The default is\nâ+ â.\nSHELL\nThis variable expands to the full pathname to the shell.\nIf it is not set when the shell starts,\nbash\nassigns to it\nthe full pathname of the current user's login shell.\nTIMEFORMAT\nThe value of this parameter is used as a format string\nspecifying how the timing information for pipelines\nprefixed with the\ntime\nreserved word should be displayed.\nThe\n%\ncharacter introduces an escape sequence that is\nexpanded to a time value or other information.  The escape\nsequences and their meanings are as follows; the brackets\ndenote optional portions.\n%%\nA literal\n%\n.\n%[\np\n][l]R\nThe elapsed time in seconds.\n%[\np\n][l]U\nThe number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.\n%[\np\n][l]S\nThe number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.\n%P\nThe CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.\nThe optional\np\nis a digit specifying the\nprecision\n, the\nnumber of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value\nof 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.\ntime\nprints at most six digits after the decimal point;\nvalues of\np\ngreater than 6 are changed to 6.  If\np\nis not\nspecified,\ntime\nprints three digits after the decimal\npoint.\nThe optional\nl\nspecifies a longer format, including\nminutes, of the form\nMM\nm\nSS\n.\nFF\ns.  The value of\np\ndetermines\nwhether or not the fraction is included.\nIf this variable is not set,\nbash\nacts as if it had the\nvalue\n$'\\nreal\\t%3lR\\nuser\\t%3lU\\nsys\\t%3lS'\n.  If the value\nis null,\nbash\ndoes not display any timing information.  A\ntrailing newline is added when the format string is\ndisplayed.\nTMOUT\nIf set to a value greater than zero, the\nread\nbuiltin uses\nthe value as its default timeout.  The\nselect\ncommand\nterminates if input does not arrive after\nTMOUT\nseconds\nwhen input is coming from a terminal.  In an interactive\nshell, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to\nwait for a line of input after issuing the primary prompt.\nBash\nterminates after waiting for that number of seconds if\na complete line of input does not arrive.\nTMPDIR\nIf set,\nbash\nuses its value as the name of a directory in\nwhich\nbash\ncreates temporary files for the shell's use.\nauto_resume\nThis variable controls how the shell interacts with the\nuser and job control.  If this variable is set, simple\ncommands consisting of only a single word, without\nredirections, are treated as candidates for resumption of\nan existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if\nthere is more than one job beginning with or containing the\nword, this selects the most recently accessed job.  The\nname\nof a stopped job, in this context, is the command line\nused to start it, as displayed by\njobs\n.  If set to the\nvalue\nexact\n, the word must match the name of a stopped job\nexactly; if set to\nsubstring\n, the word needs to match a\nsubstring of the name of a stopped job.  The\nsubstring\nvalue provides functionality analogous to the\n%?\njob\nidentifier (see\nJOB CONTROL\nbelow).  If set to any other\nvalue (e.g.,\nprefix\n), the word must be a prefix of a\nstopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous\nto the\n%\nstring\njob identifier.\nhistchars\nThe two or three characters which control history\nexpansion, quick substitution, and tokenization (see\nHISTORY EXPANSION\nbelow).  The first character is the\nhistory expansion\ncharacter, the character which begins a\nhistory expansion, normally â\n!\nâ.  The second character is\nthe\nquick substitution\ncharacter, normally â\n^\nâ.  When it\nappears as the first character on the line, history\nsubstitution repeats the previous command, replacing one\nstring with another.  The optional third character is the\nhistory comment\ncharacter,  normally â\n#\nâ, which indicates\nthat the remainder of the line is a comment when it appears\nas the first character of a word.  The history comment\ncharacter disables history substitution for the remaining\nwords on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell\nparser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.\nArrays\nBash\nprovides one-dimensional indexed and associative array\nvariables.  Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the\ndeclare\nbuiltin explicitly declares an array.  There is no maximum\nlimit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be\nindexed or assigned contiguously.  Indexed arrays are referenced\nusing arithmetic expressions that must expand to an integer (see\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\nbelow) and are zero-based; associative\narrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless otherwise\nnoted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.\nThe shell performs parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic\nexpansion, command substitution, and quote removal on indexed\narray subscripts.  Since this can potentially result in empty\nstrings, subscript indexing treats those as expressions that\nevaluate to 0.\nThe shell performs tilde expansion, parameter and variable\nexpansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, and quote\nremoval on associative array subscripts.  Empty strings cannot be\nused as associative array keys.\nBash\nautomatically creates an indexed array if any variable is\nassigned to using the syntax\nname\n[\nsubscript\n]=\nvalue\n.\nThe\nsubscript\nis treated as an arithmetic expression that must\nevaluate to a number greater than or equal to zero.  To explicitly\ndeclare an indexed array, use\ndeclare -a\nname\n(see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\ndeclare -a\nname\n[\nsubscript\n]\nis also accepted; the\nsubscript\nis ignored.\nAssociative arrays are created using\ndeclare -A\nname\n.\nAttributes may be specified for an array variable using the\ndeclare\nand\nreadonly\nbuiltins.  Each attribute applies to all\nmembers of an array.\nArrays are assigned using compound assignments of the form\nname\n=\n(\nvalue\n1\n... value\nn\n)\n, where each\nvalue\nmay be of the form\n[\nsubscript\n]=\nstring\n.  Indexed array assignments do not require\nanything but\nstring\n.  Each\nvalue\nin the list is expanded using the\nshell expansions described below under\nEXPANSION\n, but\nvalue\ns that\nare valid variable assignments including the brackets and\nsubscript do not undergo brace expansion and word splitting, as\nwith individual variable assignments.\nWhen assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and\nsubscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the\nindex of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the\nstatement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.\nWhen assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound\nassignment may be either assignment statements, for which the\nsubscript is required, or a list of words that is interpreted as a\nsequence of alternating keys and values:\nname\n=\n(\nkey1 value1 key2\nvalue2\n...\n)\n.  These are treated identically to\nname\n=\n(\n[\nkey1\n]=\nvalue1\n[\nkey2\n]=\nvalue2\n...\n)\n.  The first word in the list\ndetermines how the remaining words are interpreted; all\nassignments in a list must be of the same type.  When using\nkey/value pairs, the keys may not be missing or empty; a final\nmissing value is treated like the empty string.\nThis syntax is also accepted by the\ndeclare\nbuiltin.  Individual\narray elements may be assigned to using the\nname\n[\nsubscript\n]=\nvalue\nsyntax introduced above.\nWhen assigning to an indexed array, if\nname\nis subscripted by a\nnegative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one\ngreater than the maximum index of\nname\n, so negative indices count\nback from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the\nlast element.\nThe â+=â operator appends to an array variable when assigning\nusing the compound assignment syntax; see\nPARAMETERS\nabove.\nAn array element is referenced using ${\nname\n[\nsubscript\n]}.  The\nbraces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.\nIf\nsubscript\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the word expands to all members of\nname\n,\nunless noted in the description of a builtin or word expansion.\nThese subscripts differ only when the word appears within double\nquotes.  If the word is double-quoted, ${\nname\n[*]} expands to a\nsingle word with the value of each array member separated by the\nfirst character of the\nIFS\nspecial variable, and ${\nname\n[@]}\nexpands each element of\nname\nto a separate word.  When there are\nno array members, ${\nname\n[@]} expands to nothing.  If the double-\nquoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first\nparameter is joined with the beginning part of the expansion of\nthe original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is\njoined with the last part of the expansion of the original word.\nThis is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters\n*\nand\n@\n(see\nSpecial Parameters\nabove).\n${#\nname\n[\nsubscript\n]} expands to the length of ${\nname\n[\nsubscript\n]}.\nIf\nsubscript\nis\n*\nor\n@\n, the expansion is the number of elements in\nthe array.\nIf the\nsubscript\nused to reference an element of an indexed array\nevaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as\nrelative to one greater than the maximum index of the array, so\nnegative indices count back from the end of the array, and an\nindex of -1 references the last element.\nReferencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to\nreferencing the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a\nvariable using a valid subscript is valid;\nbash\ncreates an array\nif necessary.\nAn array variable is considered set if a subscript has been\nassigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.\nIt is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as\nthe values.  ${\n!\nname\n[\n@\n]} and ${\n!\nname\n[\n*\n]} expand to the indices\nassigned in array variable\nname\n.  The treatment when in double\nquotes is similar to the expansion of the special parameters\n@\nand\n*\nwithin double quotes.\nThe\nunset\nbuiltin is used to destroy arrays.\nunset\nname\n[\nsubscript\n] unsets the array element at index\nsubscript\n, for\nboth indexed and associative arrays.  Negative subscripts to\nindexed arrays are interpreted as described above.  Unsetting the\nlast element of an array variable does not unset the variable.\nunset\nname\n, where\nname\nis an array, removes the entire array.\nunset\nname\n[\nsubscript\n] behaves differently depending on whether\nname\nis an indexed or associative array when\nsubscript\nis\n*\nor\n@\n.\nIf\nname\nis an associative array, this unsets the element with\nsubscript\n*\nor\n@\n.  If\nname\nis an indexed array, unset removes all\nof the elements but does not remove the array itself.\nWhen using a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a\ncommand, such as with\nunset\n, without using the word expansion\nsyntax described above, (e.g., unset a[4]), the argument is\nsubject to pathname expansion.  Quote the argument if pathname\nexpansion is not desired (e.g., unset 'a[4]').\nThe\ndeclare\n,\nlocal\n, and\nreadonly\nbuiltins each accept a\n-a\noption\nto specify an indexed array and a\n-A\noption to specify an\nassociative array.  If both options are supplied,\n-A\ntakes\nprecedence.  The\nread\nbuiltin accepts a\n-a\noption to assign a list\nof words read from the standard input to an array.  The\nset\nand\ndeclare\nbuiltins display array values in a way that allows them to\nbe reused as assignments.  Other builtins accept array name\narguments as well (e.g.,\nmapfile\n); see the descriptions of\nindividual builtins below for details.  The shell provides a\nnumber of builtin array variables.\nEXPANSION\ntop\nExpansion is performed on the command line after it has been split\ninto words.  The shell performs these expansions:\nbrace expansion\n,\ntilde expansion\n,\nparameter and variable expansion\n,\ncommand\nsubstitution\n,\narithmetic expansion\n,\nword splitting\n,\npathname\nexpansion\n, and\nquote removal\n.\nThe order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion,\nparameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and\ncommand substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word\nsplitting; pathname expansion; and quote removal.\nOn systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion\navailable:\nprocess substitution\n.  This is performed at the same\ntime as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and\ncommand substitution.\nQuote removal\nis always performed last.  It removes quote\ncharacters present in the original word, not ones resulting from\none of the other expansions, unless they have been quoted\nthemselves.\nOnly brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can\nincrease the number of words of the expansion; other expansions\nexpand a single word to a single word.  The only exceptions to\nthis are the expansions of\n\"$@\"\nand\n\"${\nname\n[@]}\"\n, and, in most\ncases,\n$*\nand\n${\nname\n[*]}\nas explained above (see\nPARAMETERS\n).\nBrace Expansion\nBrace expansion\nis a mechanism to generate arbitrary strings\nsharing a common prefix and suffix, either of which can be empty.\nThis mechanism is similar to\npathname expansion\n, but the filenames\ngenerated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded are\nformed from an optional\npreamble\n, followed by either a series of\ncomma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of\nbraces, followed by an optional\npostscript\n.  The preamble is\nprefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the\npostscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding\nleft to right.\nBrace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded\nstring are not sorted; brace expansion preserves left to right\norder.  For example, a\n{\nd,c,b\n}\ne expands into âade ace abeâ.\nA sequence expression takes the form\nx\n..\ny\n[..\nincr\n]\n, where\nx\nand\ny\nare either integers or single letters, and\nincr\n, an optional\nincrement, is an integer.  When integers are supplied, the\nexpression expands to each number between\nx\nand\ny\n, inclusive.  If\neither\nx\nor\ny\nbegins with a zero, each generated term will contain\nthe same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When\nletters are supplied, the expression expands to each character\nlexicographically between\nx\nand\ny\n, inclusive, using the C locale.\nNote that both\nx\nand\ny\nmust be of the same type (integer or\nletter).  When the increment is supplied, it is used as the\ndifference between each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as\nappropriate.\nBrace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any\ncharacters special to other expansions are preserved in the\nresult.  It is strictly textual.\nBash\ndoes not apply any\nsyntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the\ntext between the braces.\nA correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening\nand closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid\nsequence expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is\nleft unchanged.\nA â{â or Q , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being\nconsidered part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with\nparameter expansion, the string â${â is not considered eligible\nfor brace expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the\nclosing â}â.\nThis construct is typically used as shorthand when the common\nprefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above\nexample:\nmkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}\nor\nchown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}\nBrace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with\nhistorical versions of\nsh\n.\nsh\ndoes not treat opening or closing\nbraces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves\nthem in the output.\nBash\nremoves braces from words as a\nconsequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word entered to\nsh\nas âfile{1,2}â appears identically in the output.\nBash\noutputs\nthat word as âfile1 file2â after brace expansion.  Start\nbash\nwith\nthe\n+B\noption or disable brace expansion with the\n+B\noption to the\nset\ncommand (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow) for strict\nsh\ncompatibility.\nTilde Expansion\nIf a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (â\n~\nâ), all of\nthe characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all\ncharacters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a\ntilde-\nprefix\n.  If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted,\nthe characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated\nas a possible\nlogin name\n.  If this login name is the null string,\nthe tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter\nHOME\n.\nIf\nHOME\nis unset, the tilde expands to the home directory of the\nuser executing the shell instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is\nreplaced with the home directory associated with the specified\nlogin name.\nIf the tilde-prefix is a â~+â, the value of the shell variable\nPWD\nreplaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a â~-â, the\nshell substitutes the value of the shell variable\nOLDPWD\n, if it is\nset.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix\nconsist of a number\nN\n, optionally prefixed by a â+â or a â-â, the\ntilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the\ndirectory stack, as it would be displayed by the\ndirs\nbuiltin\ninvoked with the characters following the tilde in the tilde-\nprefix as an argument.  If the characters following the tilde in\nthe tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading â+â or â-â,\ntilde expansion assumes â+â.\nThe results of tilde expansion are treated as if they were quoted,\nso the replacement is not subject to word splitting and pathname\nexpansion.\nIf the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the\ntilde-prefix is unchanged.\nBash\nchecks each variable assignment for unquoted tilde-prefixes\nimmediately following a\n:\nor the first\n=\n, and performs tilde\nexpansion in these cases.  Consequently, one may use filenames\nwith tildes in assignments to\nPATH\n,\nMAILPATH\n, and\nCDPATH\n, and the\nshell assigns the expanded value.\nBash\nalso performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the\nconditions of variable assignments (as described above under\nPARAMETERS\n) when they appear as arguments to simple commands.\nBash\ndoes not do this, except for the\ndeclaration\ncommands listed\nabove, when in posix mode.\nParameter Expansion\nThe â\n$\nâ character introduces parameter expansion, command\nsubstitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or\nsymbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are\noptional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from\ncharacters immediately following it which could be interpreted as\npart of the name.\nWhen braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first â\n}\nâ\nnot escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not\nwithin an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or\nparameter expansion.\nThe basic form of parameter expansion is\n${\nparameter\n}\nwhich substitutes the value of\nparameter\n.  The braces are required\nwhen\nparameter\nis a positional parameter with more than one digit,\nor when\nparameter\nis followed by a character which is not to be\ninterpreted as part of its name.  The\nparameter\nis a shell\nparameter as described above\nPARAMETERS\n) or an array reference\n(\nArrays\n).\nIf the first character of\nparameter\nis an exclamation point (\n!\n),\nand\nparameter\nis not a\nnameref\n, it introduces a level of\nindirection.\nBash\nuses the value formed by expanding the rest of\nparameter\nas the new\nparameter\n; this new parameter is then\nexpanded and that value is used in the rest of the expansion,\nrather than the expansion of the original\nparameter\n.  This is\nknown as\nindirect expansion\n.  The value is subject to tilde\nexpansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and\narithmetic expansion.  If\nparameter\nis a nameref, this expands to\nthe name of the parameter referenced by\nparameter\ninstead of\nperforming the complete indirect expansion, for compatibility.\nThe exceptions to this are the expansions of ${\n!\nprefix\n*\n} and\n${\n!\nname\n[\n@\n]} described below.  The exclamation point must\nimmediately follow the left brace in order to introduce\nindirection.\nIn each of the cases below,\nword\nis subject to tilde expansion,\nparameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic\nexpansion.\nWhen not performing substring expansion, using the forms\ndocumented below (e.g.,\n:-\n),\nbash\ntests for a parameter that is\nunset or null.  Omitting the colon tests only for a parameter that\nis unset.\n${\nparameter\n:-\nword\n}\nUse Default Values\n.  If\nparameter\nis unset or null, the\nexpansion of\nword\nis substituted.  Otherwise, the value of\nparameter\nis substituted.\n${\nparameter\n:=\nword\n}\nAssign Default Values\n.  If\nparameter\nis unset or null, the\nexpansion of\nword\nis assigned to\nparameter\n, and the\nexpansion is the final value of\nparameter\n.  Positional\nparameters and special parameters may not be assigned in\nthis way.\n${\nparameter\n:?\nword\n}\nDisplay Error if Null or Unset\n.  If\nparameter\nis null or\nunset, the shell writes the expansion of\nword\n(or a message\nto that effect if\nword\nis not present) to the standard\nerror and, if it is not interactive, exits with a non-zero\nstatus.  An interactive shell does not exit, but does not\nexecute the command associated with the expansion.\nOtherwise, the value of\nparameter\nis substituted.\n${\nparameter\n:+\nword\n}\nUse Alternate Value\n.  If\nparameter\nis null or unset,\nnothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of\nword\nis\nsubstituted.  The value of\nparameter\nis not used.\n${\nparameter\n:\noffset\n}\n${\nparameter\n:\noffset\n:\nlength\n}\nSubstring Expansion\n.  Expands to up to\nlength\ncharacters of\nthe value of\nparameter\nstarting at the character specified\nby\noffset\n.  If\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, an indexed array\nsubscripted by\n@\nor\n*\n, or an associative array name, the\nresults differ as described below.  If\n:\nlength\nis omitted\n(the first form above), this expands to the substring of\nthe value of\nparameter\nstarting at the character specified\nby\noffset\nand extending to the end of the value.  If\noffset\nis omitted, it is treated as 0.  If\nlength\nis omitted, but\nthe colon after\noffset\nis present, it is treated as 0.\nlength\nand\noffset\nare arithmetic expressions (see\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\nbelow).\nIf\noffset\nevaluates to a number less than zero, the value\nis used as an offset in characters from the end of the\nvalue of\nparameter\n.  If\nlength\nevaluates to a number less\nthan zero, it is interpreted as an offset in characters\nfrom the end of the value of\nparameter\nrather than a number\nof characters, and the expansion is the characters between\noffset\nand that result.  Note that a negative offset must\nbe separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid\nbeing confused with the\n:-\nexpansion.\nIf\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the result is\nlength\npositional\nparameters beginning at\noffset\n.  A negative\noffset\nis taken\nrelative to one greater than the greatest positional\nparameter, so an offset of -1 evaluates to the last\npositional parameter (or 0 if there are no positional\nparameters).  It is an expansion error if\nlength\nevaluates\nto a number less than zero.\nIf\nparameter\nis an indexed array name subscripted by @ or\n*, the result is the\nlength\nmembers of the array beginning\nwith ${\nparameter\n[\noffset\n]}.  A negative\noffset\nis taken\nrelative to one greater than the maximum index of the\nspecified array.  It is an expansion error if\nlength\nevaluates to a number less than zero.\nSubstring expansion applied to an associative array\nproduces undefined results.\nSubstring indexing is zero-based unless the positional\nparameters are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1\nby default.  If\noffset\nis 0, and the positional parameters\nare used,\n$0\nis prefixed to the list.\n${\n!\nprefix\n*\n}\n${\n!\nprefix\n@\n}\nNames matching prefix\n.  Expands to the names of variables\nwhose names begin with\nprefix\n, separated by the first\ncharacter of the\nIFS\nspecial variable.  When\n@\nis used and\nthe expansion appears within double quotes, each variable\nname expands to a separate word.\n${\n!\nname\n[\n@\n]}\n${\n!\nname\n[\n*\n]}\nList of array keys\n.  If\nname\nis an array variable, expands\nto the list of array indices (keys) assigned in\nname\n.  If\nname\nis not an array, expands to 0 if\nname\nis set and null\notherwise.  When\n@\nis used and the expansion appears within\ndouble quotes, each key expands to a separate word.\n${\n#\nparameter\n}\nParameter length\n.  Substitutes the length in characters of\nthe expanded value of\nparameter\n.  If\nparameter\nis\n*\nor\n@\n,\nthe value substituted is the number of positional\nparameters.  If\nparameter\nis an array name subscripted by\n*\nor\n@\n, the value substituted is the number of elements in\nthe array.  If\nparameter\nis an indexed array name\nsubscripted by a negative number, that number is\ninterpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum\nindex of\nparameter\n, so negative indices count back from the\nend of the array, and an index of -1 references the last\nelement.\n${\nparameter\n#\nword\n}\n${\nparameter\n##\nword\n}\nRemove matching prefix pattern\n.  The\nword\nis expanded to\nproduce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and\nmatched against the expanded value of\nparameter\nusing the\nrules described under\nPattern Matching\nbelow.  If the\npattern matches the beginning of the value of\nparameter\n,\nthen the result of the expansion is the expanded value of\nparameter\nwith the shortest matching pattern (the â#â case)\nor the longest matching pattern (the â##â case) deleted.\nIf\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the pattern removal operation is\napplied to each positional parameter in turn, and the\nexpansion is the resultant list.  If\nparameter\nis an array\nvariable subscripted with\n@\nor\n*\n, the pattern removal\noperation is applied to each member of the array in turn,\nand the expansion is the resultant list.\n${\nparameter\n%\nword\n}\n${\nparameter\n%%\nword\n}\nRemove matching suffix pattern\n.  The\nword\nis expanded to\nproduce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and\nmatched against the expanded value of\nparameter\nusing the\nrules described under\nPattern Matching\nbelow.  If the\npattern matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of\nparameter\n, then the result of the expansion is the expanded\nvalue of\nparameter\nwith the shortest matching pattern (the\nâ%â case) or the longest matching pattern (the â%%â case)\ndeleted.  If\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the pattern removal\noperation is applied to each positional parameter in turn,\nand the expansion is the resultant list.  If\nparameter\nis\nan array variable subscripted with\n@\nor\n*\n, the pattern\nremoval operation is applied to each member of the array in\nturn, and the expansion is the resultant list.\n${\nparameter\n/\npattern\n/\nstring\n}\n${\nparameter\n//\npattern\n/\nstring\n}\n${\nparameter\n/#\npattern\n/\nstring\n}\n${\nparameter\n/%\npattern\n/\nstring\n}\nPattern substitution\n.  The\npattern\nis expanded to produce a\npattern and matched against the expanded value of\nparameter\nas described under\nPattern Matching\nbelow.  The longest\nmatch of\npattern\nin the expanded value is replaced with\nstring\n.\nstring\nundergoes tilde expansion, parameter and\nvariable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command and\nprocess substitution, and quote removal.\nIn the first form above, only the first match is replaced.\nIf there are two slashes separating\nparameter\nand\npattern\n(the second form above), all matches of\npattern\nare\nreplaced with\nstring\n.  If\npattern\nis preceded by\n#\n(the\nthird form above), it must match at the beginning of the\nexpanded value of\nparameter\n.  If\npattern\nis preceded by\n%\n(the fourth form above), it must match at the end of the\nexpanded value of\nparameter\n.\nIf the expansion of\nstring\nis null, matches of\npattern\nare\ndeleted and the\n/\nfollowing\npattern\nmay be omitted.\nIf the\npatsub_replacement\nshell option is enabled using\nshopt\n, any unquoted instances of\n&\nin\nstring\nare replaced\nwith the matching portion of\npattern\n.\nQuoting any part of\nstring\ninhibits replacement in the\nexpansion of the quoted portion, including replacement\nstrings stored in shell variables.  Backslash escapes\n&\nin\nstring\n; the backslash is removed in order to permit a\nliteral\n&\nin the replacement string.  Backslash can also be\nused to escape a backslash;\n\\\\\nresults in a literal\nbackslash in the replacement.  Users should take care if\nstring\nis double-quoted to avoid unwanted interactions\nbetween the backslash and double-quoting, since backslash\nhas special meaning within double quotes.  Pattern\nsubstitution performs the check for unquoted\n&\nafter\nexpanding\nstring\n; shell programmers should quote any\noccurrences of\n&\nthey want to be taken literally in the\nreplacement and ensure any instances of\n&\nthey want to be\nreplaced are unquoted.\nLike the pattern removal operators, double quotes\nsurrounding the replacement string quote the expanded\ncharacters, while double quotes enclosing the entire\nparameter substitution do not, since the expansion is\nperformed in a context that doesn't take any enclosing\ndouble quotes into account.\nIf the\nnocasematch\nshell option is enabled, the match is\nperformed without regard to the case of alphabetic\ncharacters.\nIf\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the substitution operation is\napplied to each positional parameter in turn, and the\nexpansion is the resultant list.  If\nparameter\nis an array\nvariable subscripted with\n@\nor\n*\n, the substitution\noperation is applied to each member of the array in turn,\nand the expansion is the resultant list.\n${\nparameter\n^\npattern\n}\n${\nparameter\n^^\npattern\n}\n${\nparameter\n,\npattern\n}\n${\nparameter\n,,\npattern\n}\nCase modification\n.  This expansion modifies the case of\nalphabetic characters in\nparameter\n.  First, the\npattern\nis\nexpanded to produce a pattern as described below under\nPattern Matching\n.\nBash\nthen examines characters in the\nexpanded value of\nparameter\nagainst\npattern\nas described\nbelow.  If a character matches the pattern, its case is\nconverted.  The pattern should not attempt to match more\nthan one character.\nUsing â^â converts lowercase letters matching\npattern\nto\nuppercase; â,â converts matching uppercase letters to\nlowercase.  The\n^\nand\n,\nvariants examine the first\ncharacter in the expanded value and convert its case if it\nmatches\npattern\n; the\n^^\nand\n,,\nvariants examine all\ncharacters in the expanded value and convert each one that\nmatches\npattern\n.  If\npattern\nis omitted, it is treated like\na\n?\n, which matches every character.\nIf\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the case modification operation is\napplied to each positional parameter in turn, and the\nexpansion is the resultant list.

The keys\nand values are quoted in a format that can be reused\nas input.\na\nThe expansion is a string consisting of flag values\nrepresenting\nparameter\n's attributes.\nk\nLike the K transformation, but expands the keys and\nvalues of indexed and associative arrays to separate\nwords after word splitting.\nIf\nparameter\nis\n@\nor\n*\n, the operation is applied to each\npositional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the\nresultant list.  If\nparameter\nis an array variable\nsubscripted with\n@\nor\n*\n, the operation is applied to each\nmember of the array in turn, and the expansion is the\nresultant list.\nThe result of the expansion is subject to word splitting\nand pathname expansion as described below.\nCommand Substitution\nCommand substitution\nallows the output of a command to replace the\ncommand itself.  There are two standard forms:\n$(\ncommand\n)\nor (deprecated)\n`\ncommand\n`\n.\nBash\nperforms the expansion by executing\ncommand\nin a subshell\nenvironment and replacing the command substitution with the\nstandard output of the command, with any trailing newlines\ndeleted.  Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be\nremoved during word splitting.  The command substitution\n$(cat\nfile\n)\ncan be replaced by the equivalent but faster\n$(<\nfile\n)\n.\nWith the old-style backquote form of substitution, backslash\nretains its literal meaning except when followed by\n$\n,\n`\n, or\n\\\n.\nThe first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the\ncommand substitution.  When using the $(\ncommand\n) form, all\ncharacters between the parentheses make up the command; none are\ntreated specially.\nThere is an alternate form of command substitution:\n${\nc command\n;}\nwhich executes\ncommand\nin the current execution environment and\ncaptures its output, again with trailing newlines removed.\nThe character\nc\nfollowing the open brace must be a space, tab,\nnewline, or\n|\n, and the close brace must be in a position where a\nreserved word may appear (i.e., preceded by a command terminator\nsuch as semicolon).\nBash\nallows the close brace to be joined to\nthe remaining characters in the word without being followed by a\nshell metacharacter as a reserved word would usually require.\nAny side effects of\ncommand\ntake effect immediately in the current\nexecution environment and persist in the current environment after\nthe command completes (e.g., the\nexit\nbuiltin exits the shell).\nThis type of command substitution superficially resembles\nexecuting an unnamed shell function: local variables are created\nas when a shell function is executing, and the\nreturn\nbuiltin\nforces\ncommand\nto complete; however, the rest of the execution\nenvironment, including the positional parameters, is shared with\nthe caller.\nIf the first character following the open brace is a\n|\n, the\nconstruct expands to the value of the\nREPLY\nshell variable after\ncommand\nexecutes, without removing any trailing newlines, and the\nstandard output of\ncommand\nremains the same as in the calling\nshell.\nBash\ncreates\nREPLY\nas an initially-unset local variable\nwhen\ncommand\nexecutes, and restores\nREPLY\nto the value it had\nbefore the command substitution after\ncommand\ncompletes, as with\nany local variable.\nCommand substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the\nbackquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.\nIf the substitution appears within double quotes,\nbash\ndoes not\nperform word splitting and pathname expansion on the results.\nArithmetic Expansion\nArithmetic expansion evaluates an arithmetic expression and\nsubstitutes the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:\n$((\nexpression\n))\nThe\nexpression\nundergoes the same expansions as if it were within\ndouble quotes, but unescaped double quote characters in\nexpression\nare not treated specially and are removed.  All tokens in the\nexpression undergo parameter and variable expansion, command\nsubstitution, and quote removal.  The result is treated as the\narithmetic expression to be evaluated.  Since the way Bash handles\ndouble quotes can potentially result in empty strings, arithmetic\nexpansion treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.\nArithmetic expansions may be nested.\nThe evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below\nunder\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\n.  If\nexpression\nis invalid,\nbash\nprints a message to standard error indicating failure, does not\nperform the substitution, and does not execute the command\nassociated with the expansion.\nProcess Substitution\nProcess substitution\nallows a process's input or output to be\nreferred to using a filename.  It takes the form of\n<(\nlist\n)\nor\n>(\nlist\n)\n.  The process\nlist\nis run asynchronously, and its input or\noutput appears as a filename.  This filename is passed as an\nargument to the current command as the result of the expansion.\nIf the\n>(\nlist\n)\nform is used, writing to the file provides input\nfor\nlist\n.  If the\n<(\nlist\n)\nform is used, reading the file obtains\nthe output of\nlist\n.  No space may appear between the\n<\nor\n>\nand\nthe left parenthesis, otherwise the construct would be interpreted\nas a redirection.\nProcess substitution is supported on systems that support named\npipes (\nFIFOs\n) or the\n/dev/fd\nmethod of naming open files.\nWhen available, process substitution is performed simultaneously\nwith parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and\narithmetic expansion.\nWord Splitting\nThe shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command\nsubstitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within\ndouble quotes for\nword splitting\n.  Words that were not expanded\nare not split.\nThe shell treats each character of\nIFS\nas a delimiter, and splits\nthe results of the other expansions into words using these\ncharacters as field terminators.\nAn\nIFS whitespace\ncharacter is whitespace as defined above (see\nDefinitions\n) that appears in the value of\nIFS\n.  Space, tab, and\nnewline are always considered IFS whitespace, even if they don't\nappear in the locale's\nspace\ncategory.\nIf\nIFS\nis unset, field splitting acts as if its value were\n<space><tab><newline>\n, and treats these characters as IFS\nwhitespace.  If the value of\nIFS\nis null, no word splitting\noccurs, but implicit null arguments (see below) are still removed.\nWord splitting begins by removing sequences of IFS whitespace\ncharacters from the beginning and end of the results of the\nprevious expansions, then splits the remaining words.\nIf the value of\nIFS\nconsists solely of IFS whitespace, any\nsequence of IFS whitespace characters delimits a field, so a field\nconsists of characters that are not unquoted IFS whitespace, and\nnull fields result only from quoting.\nIf\nIFS\ncontains a non-whitespace character, then any character in\nthe value of\nIFS\nthat is not IFS whitespace, along with any\nadjacent IFS whitespace characters, delimits a field.  This means\nthat adjacent non-IFS-whitespace delimiters produce a null field.\nA sequence of IFS whitespace characters also delimits a field.\nExplicit null arguments (\n\"\"\nor\n''\n) are retained and passed to\ncommands as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments,\nresulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values,\nare removed.  Expanding a parameter with no value within double\nquotes produces a null field, which is retained and passed to a\ncommand as an empty string.\nWhen a quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose\nexpansion is non-null, word splitting removes the null argument\nportion, leaving the non-null expansion.  That is, the word â-d''â\nbecomes â-dâ after word splitting and null argument removal.\nPathname Expansion\nAfter word splitting, unless the\n-f\noption has been set,\nbash\nscans each word for the characters\n*\n,\n?\n, and\n[\n.  If one of these\ncharacters appears, and is not quoted, then the word is regarded\nas a\npattern\n, and replaced with a sorted list of filenames\nmatching the pattern (see\nPattern Matching\nbelow) subject to the\nvalue of the\nGLOBSORT\nshell variable.\nIf no matching filenames are found, and the shell option\nnullglob\nis not enabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the\nnullglob\noption is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed.  If\nthe\nfailglob\nshell option is set, and no matches are found,\nbash\nprints an error message and does not execute the command.  If the\nshell option\nnocaseglob\nis enabled, the match is performed without\nregard to the case of alphabetic characters.\nWhen a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character â.â\nat the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be\nmatched explicitly, unless the shell option\ndotglob\nis set.  In\norder to match the filenames\n.\nand\n..\n, the pattern must begin with\nâ.â (for example, â.?â), even if\ndotglob\nis set.  If the\nglobskipdots\nshell option is enabled, the filenames\n.\nand\n..\nnever\nmatch, even if the pattern begins with a â.â.  When not matching\npathnames, the â.â character is not treated specially.\nWhen matching a pathname, the slash character must always be\nmatched explicitly by a slash in the pattern, but in other\nmatching contexts it can be matched by a special pattern character\nas described below under\nPattern Matching\n.\nSee the description of\nshopt\nbelow under\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nfor a description of the\nnocaseglob\n,\nnullglob\n,\nglobskipdots\n,\nfailglob\n, and\ndotglob\nshell options.\nThe\nGLOBIGNORE\nshell variable may be used to restrict the set of\nfile names matching a\npattern\n.  If\nGLOBIGNORE\nis set, each\nmatching file name that also matches one of the patterns in\nGLOBIGNORE\nis removed from the list of matches.  If the\nnocaseglob\noption is set, the matching against the patterns in\nGLOBIGNORE\nis\nperformed without regard to case.  The filenames\n.\nand\n..\nare\nalways ignored when\nGLOBIGNORE\nis set and not null.  However,\nsetting\nGLOBIGNORE\nto a non-null value has the effect of enabling\nthe\ndotglob\nshell option, so all other filenames beginning with a\nâ.â match.  To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames\nbeginning with a â.â, make â.*â  one of the patterns in\nGLOBIGNORE\n.  The\ndotglob\noption is disabled when\nGLOBIGNORE\nis\nunset.  The\nGLOBIGNORE\npattern matching honors the setting of the\nextglob\nshell option.\nThe value of the\nGLOBSORT\nshell variable controls how the results\nof pathname expansion are sorted, as described above under\nShell\nVariables\n.\nPattern Matching\nAny character that appears in a pattern, other than the special\npattern characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL\ncharacter may not occur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes the\nfollowing character; the escaping backslash is discarded when\nmatching.  The special pattern characters must be quoted if they\nare to be matched literally.\nThe special pattern characters have the following meanings:\n*\nMatches any string, including the null string.  When\nthe\nglobstar\nshell option is enabled, and\n*\nis used\nin a pathname expansion context, two adjacent\n*\ns\nused as a single pattern match all files and zero or\nmore directories and subdirectories.  If followed by\na\n/\n, two adjacent\n*\ns match only directories and\nsubdirectories.\n?\nMatches any single character.\n[\n...\n]\nMatches any one of the characters enclosed between\nthe brackets.  This is known as a\nbracket expression\nand matches a single character.  A pair of\ncharacters separated by a hyphen denotes a\nrange\nexpression\n; any character that falls between those\ntwo characters, inclusive, using the current\nlocale's collating sequence and character set,\nmatches.  If the first character following the\n[\nis\na\n!\nor a\n^\nthen any character not within the range\nmatches.  To match a\n-\n, include it as the first or\nlast character in the set.  To match a\n]\n, include it\nas the first character in the set.\nThe sorting order of characters in range\nexpressions, and the characters included in the\nrange, are determined by the current locale and the\nvalues of the\nLC_COLLATE\nor\nLC_ALL\nshell variables,\nif set.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of\nrange expressions, where\n[a-d]\nis equivalent to\n[abcd]\n, set the value of the\nLC_COLLATE\nor\nLC_ALL\nshell variables to\nC\n, or enable the\nglobasciiranges\nshell option.\nWithin a bracket expression,\ncharacter classes\ncan\nbe specified using the syntax\n[:\nclass\n:]\n, where\nclass\nis one of the following classes defined in the POSIX\nstandard:\nalnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower\nprint punct space upper word xdigit\nA character class matches any character belonging to\nthat class.  The\nword\ncharacter class matches\nletters, digits, and the character _.\nWithin a bracket expression, an\nequivalence class\ncan be specified using the syntax\n[=\nc\n=]\n, which\nmatches all characters with the same collation\nweight (as defined by the current locale) as the\ncharacter\nc\n.\nWithin a bracket expression, the syntax\n[.\nsymbol\n.]\nmatches the collating symbol\nsymbol\n.\nIf the\nextglob\nshell option is enabled using the\nshopt\nbuiltin,\nthe shell recognizes several extended pattern matching operators.\nIn the following description, a\npattern-list\nis a list of one or\nmore patterns separated by a\n|\n.  Composite patterns may be formed\nusing one or more of the following sub-patterns:\n?(\npattern-list\n)\nMatches zero or one occurrence of the given\npatterns.\n*(\npattern-list\n)\nMatches zero or more occurrences of the given\npatterns.\n+(\npattern-list\n)\nMatches one or more occurrences of the given\npatterns.\n@(\npattern-list\n)\nMatches one of the given patterns.\n!(\npattern-list\n)\nMatches anything except one of the given patterns.\nThe\nextglob\noption changes the behavior of the parser, since the\nparentheses are normally treated as operators with syntactic\nmeaning.  To ensure that extended matching patterns are parsed\ncorrectly, make sure that\nextglob\nis enabled before parsing\nconstructs containing the patterns, including shell functions and\ncommand substitutions.\nWhen matching filenames, the\ndotglob\nshell option determines the\nset of filenames that are tested: when\ndotglob\nis enabled, the set\nof filenames includes all files beginning with â.â, but\n.\nand\n..\nmust be matched by a pattern or sub-pattern that begins with a\ndot; when it is disabled, the set does not include any filenames\nbeginning with â.â unless the pattern or sub-pattern begins with a\nâ.â.  If the\nglobskipdots\nshell option is enabled, the filenames\n.\nand\n..\nnever appear in the set.  As above, â.â only has a special\nmeaning when matching filenames.\nComplicated extended pattern matching against long strings is\nslow, especially when the patterns contain alternations and the\nstrings contain multiple matches.  Using separate matches against\nshorter strings, or using arrays of strings instead of a single\nlong string, may be faster.\nQuote Removal\nAfter the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the\ncharacters\n\\\n,\n'\n, and\n\"\nthat did not result from one of the above\nexpansions are removed.\nREDIRECTION\ntop\nBefore a command is executed, its input and output may be\nredirected\nusing a special notation interpreted by the shell.\nRedirection\nallows commands' file handles to be duplicated,\nopened, closed, made to refer to different files, and can change\nthe files the command reads from and writes to.  When used with\nthe\nexec\nbuiltin, redirections modify file handles in the current\nshell execution environment.  The following redirection operators\nmay precede or appear anywhere within a\nsimple command\nor may\nfollow a\ncommand\n.  Redirections are processed in the order they\nappear, from left to right.\nEach redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number\nmay instead be preceded by a word of the form {\nvarname\n}.  In this\ncase, for each redirection operator except\n>&-\nand\n<&-\n, the shell\nallocates a file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and\nassigns it to\nvarname\n.  If {\nvarname\n} precedes\n>&-\nor\n<&-\n, the\nvalue of\nvarname\ndefines the file descriptor to close.  If\n{\nvarname\n} is supplied, the redirection persists beyond the scope\nof the command, which allows the shell programmer to manage the\nfile descriptor's lifetime manually without using the\nexec\nbuiltin.  The\nvarredir_close\nshell option manages this behavior.\nIn the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is\nomitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is\nâ<â, the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor\n0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is â>â,\nthe redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).\nThe\nword\nfollowing the redirection operator in the following\ndescriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace\nexpansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,\ncommand substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal,\npathname expansion, and word splitting.  If it expands to more\nthan one word,\nbash\nreports an error.\nThe order of redirections is significant.  For example, the\ncommand\nls\n>\ndirlist 2\n>&\n1\ndirects both standard output and standard error to the file\ndirlist\n, while the command\nls 2\n>&\n1\n>\ndirlist\ndirects only the standard output to file\ndirlist\n, because the\nstandard error was directed to the standard output before the\nstandard output was redirected to\ndirlist\n.\nBash\nhandles several filenames specially when they are used in\nredirections, as described in the following table.  If the\noperating system on which\nbash\nis running provides these special\nfiles,\nbash\nuses them; otherwise it emulates them internally with\nthe behavior described below.\n/dev/fd/\nfd\nIf\nfd\nis a valid integer, duplicate file descriptor\nfd\n.\n/dev/stdin\nFile descriptor 0 is duplicated.\n/dev/stdout\nFile descriptor 1 is duplicated.\n/dev/stderr\nFile descriptor 2 is duplicated.\n/dev/tcp/\nhost\n/\nport\nIf\nhost\nis a valid hostname or Internet address, and\nport\nis an integer port number or service name,\nbash\nattempts to open the corresponding TCP socket.\n/dev/udp/\nhost\n/\nport\nIf\nhost\nis a valid hostname or Internet address, and\nport\nis an integer port number or service name,\nbash\nattempts to open the corresponding UDP socket.\nA failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.\nRedirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used\nwith care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell\nuses internally.\nRedirecting Input\nRedirecting input opens the file whose name results from the\nexpansion of\nword\nfor reading on file descriptor\nn\n, or the\nstandard input (file descriptor 0) if\nn\nis not specified.\nThe general format for redirecting input is:\n[\nn\n]\n<\nword\nRedirecting Output\nRedirecting output opens the file whose name results from the\nexpansion of\nword\nfor writing on file descriptor\nn\n, or the\nstandard output (file descriptor 1) if\nn\nis not specified.  If the\nfile does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is\ntruncated to zero size.\nThe general format for redirecting output is:\n[\nn\n]\n>\nword\nIf the redirection operator is\n>\n, and the\nnoclobber\noption to the\nset\nbuiltin command has been enabled, the redirection fails if the\nfile whose name results from the expansion of\nword\nexists and is a\nregular file.  If the redirection operator is\n>|\n, or the\nredirection operator is\n>\nand the\nnoclobber\noption to the\nset\nbuiltin is not enabled,\nbash\nattempts the redirection even if the\nfile named by\nword\nexists.\nAppending Redirected Output\nRedirecting output in this fashion opens the file whose name\nresults from the expansion of\nword\nfor appending on file\ndescriptor\nn\n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if\nn\nis\nnot specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.\nThe general format for appending output is:\n[\nn\n]\n>>\nword\nRedirecting Standard Output and Standard Error\nThis construct redirects both the standard output (file descriptor\n1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file\nwhose name is the expansion of\nword\n.\nThere are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard\nerror:\n&>\nword\nand\n>&\nword\nOf the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically\nequivalent to\n>\nword\n2\n>&\n1\nWhen using the second form,\nword\nmay not expand to a number or\n-\n.\nIf it does, other redirection operators apply (see\nDuplicating\nFile Descriptors\nbelow) for compatibility reasons.\nAppending Standard Output and Standard Error\nThis construct appends both the standard output (file descriptor\n1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file\nwhose name is the expansion of\nword\n.\nThe format for appending standard output and standard error is:\n&>>\nword\nThis is semantically equivalent to\n>>\nword\n2\n>&\n1\n(see\nDuplicating File Descriptors\nbelow).\nHere Documents\nThis type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from\nthe current source until it reads a line containing only\ndelimiter\n(with no trailing blanks).  All of the lines read up to that point\nthen become the standard input (or file descriptor\nn\nif\nn\nis\nspecified) for a command.\nThe format of here-documents is:\n[\nn\n]\n<<\n[\n-\n]\nword\nhere-document\ndelimiter\nThe shell does not perform parameter and variable expansion,\ncommand substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion\non\nword\n.\nIf any part of\nword\nis quoted, the\ndelimiter\nis the result of\nquote removal on\nword\n, and the lines in the here-document are not\nexpanded.  If\nword\nis unquoted, the\ndelimiter\nis\nword\nitself, and\nthe here-document text is treated similarly to a double-quoted\nstring: all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter\nexpansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the\ncharacter sequence\n\\<newline>\nis treated literally, and\n\\\nmust be\nused to quote the characters\n\\\n,\n$\n, and\n`\n; however, double quote\ncharacters have no special meaning.\nIf the redirection operator is\n<<-\n, then the shell strips all\nleading tab characters from input lines and the line containing\ndelimiter\n.  This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be\nindented in a natural fashion.\nIf the delimiter is not quoted, the\n\\<newline>\nsequence is treated\nas a line continuation: the two lines are joined and the\nbackslash-newline is removed.  This happens while reading the\nhere-document, before the check for the ending delimiter, so\njoined lines can form the end delimiter.\nHere Strings\nA variant of here documents, the format is:\n[\nn\n]\n<<<\nword\nThe\nword\nundergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable\nexpansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote\nremoval.  Pathname expansion and word splitting are not performed.\nThe result is supplied as a single string, with a newline\nappended, to the command on its standard input (or file descriptor\nn\nif\nn\nis specified).\nDuplicating File Descriptors\nThe redirection operator\n[\nn\n]\n<&\nword\nis used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If\nword\nexpands to\none or more digits, file descriptor\nn\nis made to be a copy of that\nfile descriptor.  It is a redirection error if the digits in\nword\ndo not specify a file descriptor open for input.  If\nword\nevaluates to\n-\n, file descriptor\nn\nis closed.  If\nn\nis not\nspecified, this uses the standard input (file descriptor 0).\nThe operator\n[\nn\n]\n>&\nword\nis used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If\nn\nis\nnot specified, this uses the standard output (file descriptor 1).\nIt is a redirection error if the digits in\nword\ndo not specify a\nfile descriptor open for output.  If\nword\nevaluates to\n-\n, file\ndescriptor\nn\nis closed.  As a special case, if\nn\nis omitted, and\nword\ndoes not expand to one or more digits or\n-\n, this redirects\nthe standard output and standard error as described previously.\nMoving File Descriptors\nThe redirection operator\n[\nn\n]\n<&\ndigit\n-\nmoves the file descriptor\ndigit\nto file descriptor\nn\n, or the\nstandard input (file descriptor 0) if\nn\nis not specified.\ndigit\nis closed after being duplicated to\nn\n.\nSimilarly, the redirection operator\n[\nn\n]\n>&\ndigit\n-\nmoves the file descriptor\ndigit\nto file descriptor\nn\n, or the\nstandard output (file descriptor 1) if\nn\nis not specified.\nOpening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing\nThe redirection operator\n[\nn\n]\n<>\nword\nopens the file whose name is the expansion of\nword\nfor both\nreading and writing on file descriptor\nn\n, or on file descriptor 0\nif\nn\nis not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.\nALIASES\ntop\nAliases\nallow a string to be substituted for a word that is in a\nposition in the input where it can be the first word of a simple\ncommand.  Aliases have names and corresponding values that are set\nand unset using the\nalias\nand\nunalias\nbuiltin commands (see\nSHELL\nBUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nIf the shell reads an unquoted word in the right position, it\nchecks the word to see if it matches an alias name.  If it\nmatches, the shell replaces the word with the alias value, and\nreads that value as if it had been read instead of the word.  The\nshell doesn't look at any characters following the word before\nattempting alias substitution.\nThe characters\n/\n,\n$\n,\n`\n, and\n=\nand any of the shell\nmetacharacters\nor quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias\nname.  The replacement text may contain any valid shell input,\nincluding shell metacharacters.  The first word of the replacement\ntext is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an\nalias being expanded is not expanded a second time.  This means\nthat one may alias\nls\nto\nls -F\n, for instance, and\nbash\ndoes not\ntry to recursively expand the replacement text.\nIf the last character of the alias value is a\nblank\n, the shell\nchecks the next command word following the alias for alias\nexpansion.\nAliases are created and listed with the\nalias\ncommand, and removed\nwith the\nunalias\ncommand.\nThere is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.\nIf arguments are needed, use a shell function (see\nFUNCTIONS\nbelow) instead.\nAliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless\nthe\nexpand_aliases\nshell option is set using\nshopt\n(see the\ndescription of\nshopt\nunder\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nThe rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are\nsomewhat confusing.\nBash\nalways reads at least one complete line\nof input, and all lines that make up a compound command, before\nexecuting any of the commands on that line or the compound\ncommand.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it\nis executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same\nline as another command does not take effect until the shell reads\nthe next line of input, and an alias definition in a compound\ncommand does not take effect until the shell parses and executes\nthe entire compound command.  The commands following the alias\ndefinition on that line, or in the rest of a compound command, are\nnot affected by the new alias.  This behavior is also an issue\nwhen functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function\ndefinition is read, not when the function is executed, because a\nfunction definition is itself a command.  As a consequence,\naliases defined in a function are not available until after that\nfunction is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on\na separate line, and do not use\nalias\nin compound commands.\nFor almost every purpose, shell functions are preferable to\naliases.\nFUNCTIONS\ntop\nA shell function, defined as described above under\nSHELL GRAMMAR\n,\nstores a series of commands for later execution.  When the name of\na shell function is used as a simple command name, the shell\nexecutes the list of commands associated with that function name.\nFunctions are executed in the context of the calling shell; there\nis no new process created to interpret them (contrast this with\nthe execution of a shell script).\nWhen a function is executed, the arguments to the function become\nthe positional parameters during its execution.  The special\nparameter\n#\nis updated to reflect the new positional parameters.\nSpecial parameter\n0\nis unchanged.  The first element of the\nFUNCNAME\nvariable is set to the name of the function while the\nfunction is executing.\nAll other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical\nbetween a function and its caller with these exceptions: the\nDEBUG\nand\nRETURN\ntraps (see the description of the\ntrap\nbuiltin under\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow) are not inherited unless the\nfunction has been given the\ntrace\nattribute (see the description\nof the\ndeclare\nbuiltin below) or the\n-o functrace\nshell option has\nbeen enabled with the\nset\nbuiltin (in which case all functions\ninherit the\nDEBUG\nand\nRETURN\ntraps), and the\nERR\ntrap is not\ninherited unless the\n-o errtrace\nshell option has been enabled.\nVariables local to the function are declared with the\nlocal\nbuiltin command (\nlocal variables\n).  Ordinarily, variables and\ntheir values are shared between the function and its caller.  If a\nvariable is declared\nlocal\n, the variable's visible scope is\nrestricted to that function and its children (including the\nfunctions it calls).\nIn the following description, the\ncurrent scope\nis a currently-\nexecuting function.  Previous scopes consist of that function's\ncaller and so on, back to the âglobalâ scope, where the shell is\nnot executing any shell function.  A local variable at the current\nscope is a variable declared using the\nlocal\nor\ndeclare\nbuiltins\nin the function that is currently executing.\nLocal variables âshadowâ variables with the same name declared at\nprevious scopes.  For instance, a local variable declared in a\nfunction hides variables with the same name declared at previous\nscopes, including global variables: references and assignments\nrefer to the local variable, leaving the variables at previous\nscopes unmodified.  When the function returns, the global variable\nis once again visible.\nThe shell uses\ndynamic scoping\nto control a variable's visibility\nwithin functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible variables and\ntheir values are a result of the sequence of function calls that\ncaused execution to reach the current function.  The value of a\nvariable that a function sees depends on its value within its\ncaller, if any, whether that caller is the global scope or another\nshell function.  This is also the value that a local variable\ndeclaration shadows, and the value that is restored when the\nfunction returns.\nFor example, if a variable\nvar\nis declared as local in function\nfunc1\n, and\nfunc1\ncalls another function\nfunc2\n, references to\nvar\nmade from within\nfunc2\nresolve to the local variable\nvar\nfrom\nfunc1\n, shadowing any global variable named\nvar\n.\nThe\nunset\nbuiltin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a\nvariable is local to the current scope,\nunset\nunsets it; otherwise\nthe unset will refer to the variable found in any calling scope as\ndescribed above.  If a variable at the current local scope is\nunset, it remains so (appearing as unset) until it is reset in\nthat scope or until the function returns.  Once the function\nreturns, any instance of the variable at a previous scope becomes\nvisible.  If the unset acts on a variable at a previous scope, any\ninstance of a variable with that name that had been shadowed\nbecomes visible (see below how the\nlocalvar_unset\nshell option\nchanges this behavior).\nThe\nFUNCNEST\nvariable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0,\ndefines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations\nthat exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.\nIf the builtin command\nreturn\nis executed in a function, the\nfunction completes and execution resumes with the next command\nafter the function call.  If\nreturn\nis supplied a numeric\nargument, that is the function's return status; otherwise the\nfunction's return status is the exit status of the last command\nexecuted before the\nreturn\n.  Any command associated with the\nRETURN\ntrap is executed before execution resumes.  When a function\ncompletes, the values of the positional parameters and the special\nparameter\n#\nare restored to the values they had prior to the\nfunction's execution.\nThe\n-f\noption to the\ndeclare\nor\ntypeset\nbuiltin commands lists\nfunction names and definitions.  The\n-F\noption to\ndeclare\nor\ntypeset\nlists the function names only (and optionally the source\nfile and line number, if the\nextdebug\nshell option is enabled).\nFunctions may be exported so that child shell processes (those\ncreated when executing a separate shell invocation) automatically\nhave them defined with the\n-f\noption to the\nexport\nbuiltin.  The\n-f\noption to the\nunset\nbuiltin deletes a function definition.\nFunctions may be recursive.  The\nFUNCNEST\nvariable may be used to\nlimit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number\nof function invocations.  By default,\nbash\nimposes no limit on the\nnumber of recursive calls.\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\ntop\nThe shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under\ncertain circumstances (see the\nlet\nand\ndeclare\nbuiltin commands,\nthe\n((\ncompound command, the arithmetic\nfor\ncommand, the\n[[\nconditional command, and\nArithmetic Expansion\n).\nEvaluation is done in the largest fixed-width integers available,\nwith no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and\nflagged as an error.  The operators and their precedence,\nassociativity, and values are the same as in the C language.  The\nfollowing list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-\nprecedence operators.  The levels are listed in order of\ndecreasing precedence.\nid\n++\nid\n--\nvariable post-increment and post-decrement\n++\nid\n--\nid\nvariable pre-increment and pre-decrement\n- +\nunary minus and plus\n! ~\nlogical and bitwise negation\n**\nexponentiation\n* / %\nmultiplication, division, remainder\n+ -\naddition, subtraction\n<< >>\nleft and right bitwise shifts\n<= >= < >\ncomparison\n== !=\nequality and inequality\n&\nbitwise AND\n^\nbitwise exclusive OR\n|\nbitwise OR\n&&\nlogical AND\n||\nlogical OR\nexpr\n?\nexpr\n:\nexpr\nconditional operator\n= *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=\nassignment\nexpr1\n,\nexpr2\ncomma\nShell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is\nperformed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an\nexpression, shell variables may also be referenced by name without\nusing the parameter expansion syntax.  This means you can use \"x\",\nwhere\nx\nis a shell variable name, in an arithmetic expression, and\nthe shell will evaluate its value as an expression and use the\nresult.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0\nwhen referenced by name in an expression.\nThe value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression\nwhen it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the\ninteger\nattribute using\ndeclare -i\nis assigned a value.  A null\nvalue evaluates to 0.  A shell variable need not have its\ninteger\nattribute turned on to be used in an expression.\nInteger constants follow the C language definition, without\nsuffixes or character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are\ninterpreted as octal numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes\nhexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take the form [\nbase#\n]n, where the\noptional\nbase\nis a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing\nthe arithmetic base, and\nn\nis a number in that base.  If\nbase#\nis\nomitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying\nn\n, if a non-digit\nis required, the digits greater than 9 are represented by the\nlowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.\nIf\nbase\nis less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase\nletters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between\n10 and 35.\nOperators are evaluated in precedence order.  Sub-expressions in\nparentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence\nrules above.\nCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS\ntop\nConditional expressions are used by the\n[[\ncompound command and\nthe\ntest\nand\n[\nbuiltin commands to test file attributes and\nperform string and arithmetic comparisons.  The\ntest\nand\n[\ncommands determine their behavior based on the number of\narguments; see the descriptions of those commands for any other\ncommand-specific actions.\nExpressions are formed from the unary or binary primaries listed\nbelow.  Unary expressions are often used to examine the status of\na file or shell variable.  Binary operators are used for string,\nnumeric, and file attribute comparisons.\nBash\nhandles several filenames specially when they are used in\nexpressions.  If the operating system on which\nbash\nis running\nprovides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it\nwill emulate them internally with this behavior: If any\nfile\nargument to one of the primaries is of the form\n/dev/fd/n\n, then\nbash\nchecks file descriptor\nn\n.  If the\nfile\nargument to one of the\nprimaries is one of\n/dev/stdin\n,\n/dev/stdout\n, or\n/dev/stderr\n,\nbash\nchecks file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively.\nUnless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow\nsymbolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than\nthe link itself.\nWhen used with\n[[\n, or when the shell is in posix mode, the\n<\nand\n>\noperators sort lexicographically using the current locale.  When\nthe shell is not in posix mode, the\ntest\ncommand sorts using ASCII\nordering.\n-a\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists.\n-b\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a block special file.\n-c\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a character special file.\n-d\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a directory.\n-e\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists.\n-f\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a regular file.\n-g\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is set-group-id.\n-h\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a symbolic link.\n-k\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and its âstickyâ bit is set.\n-p\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a named pipe (FIFO).\n-r\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is readable.\n-s\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and has a size greater than zero.\n-t\nfd\nTrue if file descriptor\nfd\nis open and refers to a\nterminal.\n-u\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and its set-user-id bit is set.\n-w\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is writable.\n-x\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is executable.\n-G\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is owned by the effective group id.\n-L\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a symbolic link.\n-N\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and has been modified since it was last\naccessed.\n-O\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is owned by the effective user id.\n-S\nfile\nTrue if\nfile\nexists and is a socket.\n-o\noptname\nTrue if the shell option\noptname\nis enabled.  See the list\nof options under the description of the\n-o\noption to the\nset\nbuiltin below.\n-v\nvarname\nTrue if the shell variable\nvarname\nis set (has been\nassigned a value).  If\nvarname\nis an indexed array variable\nname subscripted by\n@\nor\n*\n, this returns true if the array\nhas any set elements.  If\nvarname\nis an associative array\nvariable name subscripted by\n@\nor\n*\n, this returns true if\nan element with that key is set.\n-R\nvarname\nTrue if the shell variable\nvarname\nis set and is a name\nreference.\n-z\nstring\nTrue if the length of\nstring\nis zero.\nstring\n-n\nstring\nTrue if the length of\nstring\nis non-zero.\nstring1\n==\nstring2\nstring1\n=\nstring2\nTrue if the strings are equal.\n=\nshould be used with the\ntest\ncommand for POSIX conformance.  When used with the\n[[\ncommand, this performs pattern matching as described above\n(\nCompound Commands\n).\nstring1\n!=\nstring2\nTrue if the strings are not equal.\nstring1\n<\nstring2\nTrue if\nstring1\nsorts before\nstring2\nlexicographically.\nstring1\n>\nstring2\nTrue if\nstring1\nsorts after\nstring2\nlexicographically.\nfile1\n-ef\nfile2\nTrue if\nfile1\nand\nfile2\nrefer to the same device and inode\nnumbers.\nfile1\n-\nnt\nfile2\nTrue if\nfile1\nis newer (according to modification date)\nthan\nfile2\n, or if\nfile1\nexists and\nfile2\ndoes not.\nfile1\n-\not\nfile2\nTrue if\nfile1\nis older than\nfile2\n, or if\nfile2\nexists and\nfile1\ndoes not.\narg1\nOP\narg2\nOP\nis one of\n-eq\n,\n-ne\n,\n-lt\n,\n-le\n,\n-gt\n, or\n-ge\n.  These\narithmetic binary operators return true if\narg1\nis equal\nto, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater\nthan, or greater than or equal to\narg2\n, respectively.\narg1\nand\narg2\nmay be positive or negative integers.  When used\nwith the\n[[\ncommand,\narg1\nand\narg2\nare evaluated as\narithmetic expressions (see\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\nabove).\nSince the expansions the\n[[\ncommand performs on\narg1\nand\narg2\ncan potentially result in empty strings, arithmetic\nexpression evaluation treats those as expressions that\nevaluate to 0.\nSIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION\ntop\nWhen the shell executes a simple command, it performs the\nfollowing expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to\nright, in the following order.\n1.     The words that the parser has marked as variable\nassignments (those preceding the command name) and\nredirections are saved for later processing.\n2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirections\nare expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the\nfirst word is taken to be the name of the command and the\nremaining words are the arguments.\n3.     Redirections are performed as described above under\nREDIRECTION\n.\n4.     The text after the\n=\nin each variable assignment undergoes\ntilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution,\narithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being\nassigned to the variable.\nIf no command name results, the variable assignments affect the\ncurrent shell environment.  In the case of such a command (one\nthat consists only of assignment statements and redirections),\nassignment statements are performed before redirections.\nOtherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the\nexecuted command and do not affect the current shell environment.\nIf any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly\nvariable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero\nstatus.\nIf no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not\naffect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes\nthe command to exit with a non-zero status.\nIf there is a command name left after expansion, execution\nproceeds as described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If\none of the expansions contained a command substitution, the exit\nstatus of the command is the exit status of the last command\nsubstitution performed.  If there were no command substitutions,\nthe command exits with a zero status.\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\ntop\nAfter a command has been split into words, if it results in a\nsimple command and an optional list of arguments, the shell\nperforms the following actions.\nIf the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to\nlocate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that\nfunction is invoked as described above in\nFUNCTIONS\n.  If the name\ndoes not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list\nof shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.\nIf the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and\ncontains no slashes,\nbash\nsearches each element of the\nPATH\nfor a\ndirectory containing an executable file by that name.\nBash\nuses a\nhash table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see\nhash\nunder\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).  Bash performs a full\nsearch of the directories in\nPATH\nonly if the command is not found\nin the hash table.  If the search is unsuccessful, the shell\nsearches for a defined shell function named\ncommand_not_found_handle\n.  If that function exists, it is invoked\nin a separate execution environment with the original command and\nthe original command's arguments as its arguments, and the\nfunction's exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell.\nIf that function is not defined, the shell prints an error message\nand returns an exit status of 127.\nIf the search is successful, or if the command name contains one\nor more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a\nseparate execution environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name\ngiven, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the\narguments given, if any.\nIf this execution fails because the file is not in executable\nformat, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a\nshell script\n, a file containing shell commands, and the shell\ncreates a new instance of itself to execute it.  Bash tries to\ndetermine whether the file is a text file or a binary, and will\nnot execute files it determines to be binaries.  This subshell\nreinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had\nbeen invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the\nlocations of commands remembered by the parent (see\nhash\nbelow\nunder\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nare retained by the child.\nIf the program is a file beginning with\n#!\n, the remainder of the\nfirst line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell\nexecutes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do\nnot handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to\nthe interpreter consist of a single optional argument following\nthe interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by\nthe name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if\nany.\nCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT\ntop\nThe shell has an\nexecution environment\n, which consists of the\nfollowing:\nâ¢      Open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as\nmodified by redirections supplied to the\nexec\nbuiltin.\nâ¢      The current working directory as set by\ncd\n,\npushd\n, or\npopd\n,\nor inherited by the shell at invocation.\nâ¢      The file creation mode mask as set by\numask\nor inherited\nfrom the shell's parent.\nâ¢      Current traps set by\ntrap\n.\nâ¢      Shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or\nwith\nset\nor inherited from the shell's parent in the\nenvironment.\nâ¢      Shell functions defined during execution or inherited from\nthe shell's parent in the environment.\nâ¢      Options enabled at invocation (either by default or with\ncommand-line arguments) or by\nset\n.\nâ¢      Options enabled by\nshopt\n.\nâ¢      Shell aliases defined with\nalias\n.\nâ¢      Various process IDs, including those of background jobs,\nthe value of\n$$\n, and the value of\nPPID\n.\nWhen a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to\nbe executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment\nthat consists of the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the\nvalues are inherited from the shell.\nâ¢      The shell's open files, plus any modifications and\nadditions specified by redirections to the command.\nâ¢      The current working directory.\nâ¢      The file creation mode mask.\nâ¢      Shell variables and functions marked for export, along with\nvariables exported for the command, passed in the\nenvironment.\nâ¢      Traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited\nfrom the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are\nignored.\nA command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the\nshell's execution environment.\nA\nsubshell\nis a copy of the shell process.\nCommand substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and\nasynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that\nis a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught\nby the shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from\nits parent at invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked as\npart of a pipeline, except possibly in the last element depending\non the value of the\nlastpipe\nshell option, are also executed in a\nsubshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell environment\ncannot affect the shell's execution environment.\nWhen the shell is in posix mode, subshells spawned to execute\ncommand substitutions inherit the value of the\n-e\noption from\ntheir parent shell.  When not in posix mode,\nbash\nclears the\n-e\noption in such subshells.  See the description of the\ninherit_errexit\nshell option below for how to control this\nbehavior when not in posix mode.\nIf a command is followed by a\n&\nand job control is not active, the\ndefault standard input for the command is the empty file\n/dev/null\n.  Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file\ndescriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections.\nENVIRONMENT\ntop\nWhen a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called\nthe\nenvironment\n.  This is a list of\nname\n-\nvalue\npairs, of the form\nname\n=\nvalue\n.\nThe shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On\ninvocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a\nparameter for each name found, automatically marking it for\nexport\nto child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.\nThe\nexport\n,\ndeclare -x\n, and\nunset\ncommands modify the environment\nby adding and deleting parameters and functions.  If the value of\na parameter in the environment is modified, the new value\nautomatically becomes part of the environment, replacing the old.\nThe environment inherited by any executed command consists of the\nshell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the\nshell, less any pairs removed by the\nunset\nor\nexport -n\ncommands,\nplus any additions via the\nexport\nand\ndeclare -x\ncommands.\nIf any parameter assignments, as described above in\nPARAMETERS\n,\nappear before a\nsimple command\n, the variable assignments are part\nof that command's environment for as long as it executes.  These\nassignment statements affect only the environment seen by that\ncommand.  If these assignments precede a call to a shell function,\nthe variables are local to the function and exported to that\nfunction's children.\nIf the\n-k\noption is set (see the\nset\nbuiltin command below), then\nall\nparameter assignments are placed in the environment for a\ncommand, not just those that precede the command name.\nWhen\nbash\ninvokes an external command, the variable\n_\nis set to\nthe full pathname of the command and passed to that command in its\nenvironment.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nThe exit status of an executed command is the value returned by\nthe\nwaitpid\nsystem call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses\nfall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may\nuse values above 125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins\nand compound commands are also limited to this range.  Under\ncertain circumstances, the shell will use special values to\nindicate specific failure modes.\nFor the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit\nstatus has succeeded.  So while an exit status of zero indicates\nsuccess, a non-zero exit status indicates failure.\nWhen a command terminates on a fatal signal\nN\n,\nbash\nuses the value\nof 128+\nN\nas the exit status.\nIf a command is not found, the child process created to execute it\nreturns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not\nexecutable, the return status is 126.\nIf a command fails because of an error during expansion or\nredirection, the exit status is greater than zero.\nShell builtin commands return a status of 0 (\ntrue\n) if successful,\nand non-zero (\nfalse\n) if an error occurs while they execute.  All\nbuiltins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage,\ngenerally invalid options or missing arguments.\nThe exit status of the last command is available in the special\nparameter $?.\nBash\nitself returns the exit status of the last command executed,\nunless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-\nzero value.  See also the\nexit\nbuiltin command below.\nSIGNALS\ntop\nWhen\nbash\nis interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores\nSIGTERM\n(so that\nkill 0\ndoes not kill an interactive shell), and\ncatches and handles\nSIGINT\n(so that the\nwait\nbuiltin is\ninterruptible).  When\nbash\nreceives\nSIGINT\n, it breaks out of any\nexecuting loops.  In all cases,\nbash\nignores\nSIGQUIT\n.  If job\ncontrol is in effect,\nbash\nignores\nSIGTTIN\n,\nSIGTTOU\n, and\nSIGTSTP\n.\nThe\ntrap\nbuiltin modifies the shell's signal handling, as\ndescribed below.\nNon-builtin commands\nbash\nexecutes have signal handlers set to the\nvalues inherited by the shell from its parent, unless\ntrap\nsets\nthem to be ignored, in which case the child process will ignore\nthem as well.  When job control is not in effect, asynchronous\ncommands ignore\nSIGINT\nand\nSIGQUIT\nin addition to these inherited\nhandlers.  Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore\nthe keyboard-generated job control signals\nSIGTTIN\n,\nSIGTTOU\n, and\nSIGTSTP\n.\nThe shell exits by default upon receipt of a\nSIGHUP\n.  Before\nexiting, an interactive shell resends the\nSIGHUP\nto all jobs,\nrunning or stopped.  The shell sends\nSIGCONT\nto stopped jobs to\nensure that they receive the\nSIGHUP\n(see\nJOB CONTROL\nbelow for\nmore information about running and stopped jobs).  To prevent the\nshell from sending the signal to a particular job, remove it from\nthe jobs table with the\ndisown\nbuiltin (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow) or mark it not to receive\nSIGHUP\nusing\ndisown -h\n.\nIf the\nhuponexit\nshell option has been set using\nshopt\n,\nbash\nsends\na\nSIGHUP\nto all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.\nIf\nbash\nis waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal\nfor which a trap has been set, it will not execute the trap until\nthe command completes.  If\nbash\nis waiting for an asynchronous\ncommand via the\nwait\nbuiltin, and it receives a signal for which a\ntrap has been set, the\nwait\nbuiltin will return immediately with\nan exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the shell\nexecutes the trap.\nWhen job control is not enabled, and\nbash\nis waiting for a\nforeground command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-\ngenerated signals such as\nSIGINT\n(usually generated by\n^C\n) that\nusers commonly intend to send to that command.  This happens\nbecause the shell and the command are in the same process group as\nthe terminal, and\n^C\nsends\nSIGINT\nto all processes in that process\ngroup.  Since\nbash\ndoes not enable job control by default when the\nshell is not interactive, this scenario is most common in non-\ninteractive shells.\nWhen job control is enabled, and\nbash\nis waiting for a foreground\ncommand to complete, the shell does not receive keyboard-generated\nsignals, because it is not in the same process group as the\nterminal.  This scenario is most common in interactive shells,\nwhere\nbash\nattempts to enable job control by default.  See\nJOB\nCONTROL\nbelow for more information about process groups.\nWhen job control is not enabled, and\nbash\nreceives\nSIGINT\nwhile\nwaiting for a foreground command, it waits until that foreground\ncommand terminates and then decides what to do about the\nSIGINT\n:\n1.     If the command terminates due to the\nSIGINT\n,\nbash\nconcludes\nthat the user meant to send the\nSIGINT\nto the shell as\nwell, and acts on the\nSIGINT\n(e.g., by running a\nSIGINT\ntrap, exiting a non-interactive shell, or returning to the\ntop level to read a new command).\n2.     If the command does not terminate due to\nSIGINT\n, the\nprogram handled the\nSIGINT\nitself and did not treat it as a\nfatal signal.  In that case,\nbash\ndoes not treat\nSIGINT\nas\na fatal signal, either, instead assuming that the\nSIGINT\nwas used as part of the program's normal operation (e.g.,\nemacs uses it to abort editing commands) or deliberately\ndiscarded.  However,\nbash\nwill run any trap set on\nSIGINT\n,\nas it does with any other trapped signal it receives while\nit is waiting for the foreground command to complete, for\ncompatibility.\nWhen job control is enabled,\nbash\ndoes not receive keyboard-\ngenerated signals such as\nSIGINT\nwhile it is waiting for a\nforeground command.  An interactive shell does not pay attention\nto the\nSIGINT\n, even if the foreground command terminates as a\nresult, other than noting its exit status.  If the shell is not\ninteractive, and the foreground command terminates due to the\nSIGINT\n,\nbash\npretends it received the\nSIGINT\nitself (scenario 1\nabove), for compatibility.\nJOB CONTROL\ntop\nJob control\nrefers to the ability to selectively stop (\nsuspend\n)\nthe execution of processes and continue (\nresume\n) their execution\nat a later point.  A user typically employs this facility via an\ninteractive interface supplied jointly by the operating system\nkernel's terminal driver and\nbash\n.\nThe shell associates a\njob\nwith each pipeline.  It keeps a table\nof currently executing jobs, which the\njobs\ncommand will display.\nEach job has a\njob number\n, which\njobs\ndisplays between brackets.\nJob numbers start at 1.  When\nbash\nstarts a job asynchronously (in\nthe\nbackground\n), it prints a line that looks like:\n[1] 25647\nindicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID\nof the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is\n25647.  All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of\nthe same job.\nBash\nuses the\njob\nabstraction as the basis for job\ncontrol.\nTo facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job\ncontrol, each process has a\nprocess group ID\n, and the operating\nsystem maintains the notion of a\ncurrent terminal process group\nID\n.  This terminal process group ID is associated with the\ncontrolling terminal\n.\nProcesses that have the same process group ID are said to be part\nof the same\nprocess group\n.  Members of the\nforeground\nprocess\ngroup (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current\nterminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such\nas\nSIGINT\n.  Processes in the foreground process group are said to\nbe\nforeground\nprocesses.\nBackground\nprocesses are those whose\nprocess group ID differs from the controlling terminal's; such\nprocesses are immune to keyboard-generated signals.  Only\nforeground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so\nspecifies with âstty tostopâ, write to the controlling terminal.\nThe system sends a\nSIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)\nsignal to background\nprocesses which attempt to read from (write to when âtostopâ is in\neffect) the terminal, which, unless caught, suspends the process.\nIf the operating system on which\nbash\nis running supports job\ncontrol,\nbash\ncontains facilities to use it.  Typing the\nsuspend\ncharacter (typically\n^Z\n, Control-Z) while a process is running\nstops that process and returns control to\nbash\n.  Typing the\ndelayed suspend\ncharacter (typically\n^Y\n, Control-Y) causes the\nprocess stop when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and\nreturns control to\nbash\n.  The user then manipulates the state of\nthis job, using the\nbg\ncommand to continue it in the background,\nthe\nfg\ncommand to continue it in the foreground, or the\nkill\ncommand to kill it.  The suspend character takes effect\nimmediately, and has the additional side effect of discarding any\npending output and typeahead.  To force a background process to\nstop, or stop a process that's not associated with the current\nterminal session, send it the\nSIGSTOP\nsignal using\nkill\n.\nThere are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The\n%\ncharacter introduces a job specification (jobspec).\nJob number\nn\nmay be referred to as\n%n\n.  A job may also be referred\nto using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a\nsubstring that appears in its command line.  For example,\n%ce\nrefers to a job whose command name begins with\nce\n.  Using\n%?ce\n, on\nthe other hand, refers to any job containing the string\nce\nin its\ncommand line.  If the prefix or substring matches more than one\njob,\nbash\nreports an error.\nThe symbols\n%%\nand\n%+\nrefer to the shell's notion of the\ncurrent\njob\n.  A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also\nrefers to the current job.\n%-\nrefers to the\nprevious job\n.  When a\njob starts in the background, a job stops while in the foreground,\nor a job is resumed in the background, it becomes the current job.\nThe job that was the current job becomes the previous job.  When\nthe current job terminates, the previous job becomes the current\njob.  If there is only a single job,\n%+\nand\n%-\ncan both be used to\nrefer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output\nof the\njobs\ncommand), the current job is always marked with a\n+\n,\nand the previous job with a\n-\n.\nSimply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground:\n%1\nis a synonym for âfg %1â, bringing job 1 from the background\ninto the foreground.  Similarly, â%1 &â resumes job 1 in the\nbackground, equivalent to âbg %1â.\nThe shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.\nNormally,\nbash\nwaits until it is about to print a prompt before\nnotifying the user about changes in a job's status so as to not\ninterrupt any other output, though it will notify of changes in a\njob's status after a foreground command in a list completes,\nbefore executing the next command in the list.  If the\n-b\noption\nto the\nset\nbuiltin command is enabled,\nbash\nreports status changes\nimmediately.\nBash\nexecutes any trap on\nSIGCHLD\nfor each child\nthat terminates.\nWhen a job terminates and\nbash\nnotifies the user about it,\nbash\nremoves the job from the table.  It will not appear in\njobs\noutput, but\nwait\nwill report its exit status, as long as it's\nsupplied the process ID associated with the job as an argument.\nWhen the table is empty, job numbers start over at 1.\nIf a user attempts to exit\nbash\nwhile jobs are stopped (or, if the\ncheckjobs\nshell option has been enabled using the\nshopt\nbuiltin,\nrunning), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the\ncheckjobs\noption is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.\nThe\njobs\ncommand may then be used to inspect their status.  If the\nuser immediately attempts to exit again, without an intervening\ncommand,\nbash\ndoes not print another warning, and terminates any\nstopped jobs.\nWhen the shell is waiting for a job or process using the\nwait\nbuiltin, and job control is enabled,\nwait\nwill return when the job\nchanges state.  The\n-f\noption causes\nwait\nto wait until the job or\nprocess terminates before returning.\nPROMPTING\ntop\nWhen executing interactively,\nbash\ndisplays the primary prompt\nPS1\nwhen it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt\nPS2\nwhen it needs more input to complete a command.\nBash\nexamines the value of the array variable\nPROMPT_COMMAND\njust\nbefore printing each primary prompt.  If any elements in\nPROMPT_COMMAND\nare set and non-null, Bash executes each value, in\nnumeric order, just as if it had been typed on the command line.\nBash\ndisplays\nPS0\nafter it reads a command but before executing\nit.\nBash\ndisplays\nPS4\nas described above before tracing each command\nwhen the\n-x\noption is enabled.\nBash\nallows the prompt strings\nPS0\n,\nPS1\n,\nPS2\n, and\nPS4\n, to be\ncustomized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special\ncharacters that are decoded as follows:\n\\a\nAn ASCII bell character (07).\n\\d\nThe date in âWeekday Month Dateâ format (e.g., âTue\nMay 26â).\n\\D{\nformat\n}\nThe\nformat\nis passed to\nstrftime(3)\nand the result\nis inserted into the prompt string; an empty\nformat\nresults in a locale-specific time representation.\nThe braces are required.\n\\e\nAn ASCII escape character (033).\n\\h\nThe hostname up to the first â.â.\n\\H\nThe hostname.\n\\j\nThe number of jobs currently managed by the shell.\n\\l\nThe basename of the shell's terminal device name\n(e.g., âttys0â).\n\\n\nA newline.\n\\r\nA carriage return.\n\\s\nThe name of the shell: the basename of\n$0\n(the\nportion following the final slash).\n\\t\nThe current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format.\n\\T\nThe current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format.\n\\@\nThe current time in 12-hour am/pm format.\n\\A\nThe current time in 24-hour HH:MM format.\n\\u\nThe username of the current user.\n\\v\nThe\nbash\nversion (e.g., 2.00).\n\\V\nThe\nbash\nrelease, version + patch level (e.g.,\n2.00.0)\n\\w\nThe value of the\nPWD\nshell variable (\n$PWD\n), with\n$HOME\nabbreviated with a tilde (uses the value of\nthe\nPROMPT_DIRTRIM\nvariable).\n\\W\nThe basename of\n$PWD\n, with\n$HOME\nabbreviated with a\ntilde.\n\\!\nThe history number of this command.\n\\#\nThe command number of this command.\n\\$\nIf the effective UID is 0, a\n#\n, otherwise a\n$\n.\n\\\nnnn\nThe character corresponding to the octal number\nnnn\n.\n\\\\\nA backslash.\n\\[\nBegin a sequence of non-printing characters, which\ncould be used to embed a terminal control sequence\ninto the prompt.\n\\]\nEnd a sequence of non-printing characters.\nThe command number and the history number are usually different:\nthe history number of a command is its position in the history\nlist, which may include commands restored from the history file\n(see\nHISTORY\nbelow), while the command number is the position in\nthe sequence of commands executed during the current shell\nsession.  After the string is decoded, it is expanded via\nparameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,\nand quote removal, subject to the value of the\npromptvars\nshell\noption (see the description of the\nshopt\ncommand under\nSHELL\nBUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).  This can have unwanted side effects if\nescaped portions of the string appear within command substitution\nor contain characters special to word expansion.\nREADLINE\ntop\nThis is the library that handles reading input when using an\ninteractive shell, unless the\n--noediting\noption is supplied at\nshell invocation.  Line editing is also used when using the\n-e\noption to the\nread\nbuiltin.  By default, the line editing commands\nare similar to those of emacs; a vi-style line editing interface\nis also available.  Line editing can be enabled at any time using\nthe\n-o emacs\nor\n-o vi\noptions to the\nset\nbuiltin (see\nSHELL\nBUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).  To turn off line editing after the shell\nis running, use the\n+o emacs\nor\n+o vi\noptions to the\nset\nbuiltin.\nReadline Notation\nThis section uses Emacs-style editing concepts and uses its\nnotation for keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-\nkey\n, e.g.,\nC-n means Control-N.  Similarly,\nmeta\nkeys are denoted by M-\nkey\n,\nso M-x means Meta-X.  The Meta key is often labeled âAltâ or\nâOptionâ.\nOn keyboards without a\nMeta\nkey, M-\nx\nmeans ESC\nx\n, i.e., press and\nrelease the Escape key, then press and release the\nx\nkey, in\nsequence.  This makes ESC the\nmeta prefix\n.  The combination M-C-\nx\nmeans ESC Control-\nx\n: press and release the Escape key, then press\nand hold the Control key while pressing the\nx\nkey, then release\nboth.\nOn some keyboards, the Meta key modifier produces characters with\nthe eighth bit (0200) set.  You can use the\nenable-meta-key\nvariable to control whether or not it does this, if the keyboard\nallows it.  On many others, the terminal or terminal emulator\nconverts the metafied key to a key sequence beginning with ESC as\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph.\nIf your\nMeta\nkey produces a key sequence with the ESC meta prefix,\nyou can make M-\nkey\nkey bindings you specify (see\nReadline Key\nBindings\nbelow) do the same thing by setting the\nforce-meta-prefix\nvariable.\nReadline\ncommands may be given numeric\narguments\n, which normally\nact as a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the\nargument that is significant.  Passing a negative argument to a\ncommand that acts in the forward direction (e.g.,\nkill-line\n) makes\nthat command act in a backward direction.  Commands whose behavior\nwith arguments deviates from this are noted below.\nThe\npoint\nis the current cursor position, and\nmark\nrefers to a\nsaved cursor position.  The text between the point and mark is\nreferred to as the\nregion\n.\nReadline\nhas the concept of an\nactive\nregion\n: when the region is active,\nreadline\nredisplay highlights\nthe region using the value of the\nactive-region-start-color\nvariable.  The\nenable-active-region\nvariable turns this on and\noff.  Several commands set the region to active; those are noted\nbelow.\nWhen a command is described as\nkilling\ntext, the text deleted is\nsaved for possible future retrieval (\nyanking\n).  The killed text is\nsaved in a\nkill ring\n.  Consecutive kills accumulate the deleted\ntext into one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands\nwhich do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill\nring.\nReadline Initialization\nReadline\nis customized by putting commands in an initialization\nfile (the\ninputrc\nfile).  The name of this file is taken from the\nvalue of the\nINPUTRC\nshell variable.  If that variable is unset,\nthe default is\n~/.inputrc\n.  If that file  does not exist or cannot\nbe read,\nreadline\nlooks for\n/etc/inputrc\n.  When a program that\nuses the\nreadline\nlibrary starts up,\nreadline\nreads the\ninitialization file and sets the key bindings and variables found\nthere, before reading any user input.\nThere are only a few basic constructs allowed in the inputrc file.\nBlank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a\n#\nare comments.\nLines beginning with a\n$\nindicate conditional constructs.  Other\nlines denote key bindings and variable settings.\nThe default key-bindings in this section may be changed using key\nbinding commands in the\ninputrc\nfile.  Programs that use the\nreadline\nlibrary, including\nbash\n, may add their own commands and\nbindings.\nFor example, placing\nM-Control-u: universal-argument\nor\nC-Meta-u: universal-argument\ninto the\ninputrc\nwould make M-C-u execute the\nreadline\ncommand\nuniversal-argument\n.\nKey bindings may contain the following symbolic character names:\nDEL\n,\nESC\n,\nESCAPE\n,\nLFD\n,\nNEWLINE\n,\nRET\n,\nRETURN\n,\nRUBOUT\n(a destructive\nbackspace),\nSPACE\n,\nSPC\n, and\nTAB\n.\nIn addition to command names,\nreadline\nallows keys to be bound to\na string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a\nmacro\n).  The\ndifference between a macro and a command is that a macro is\nenclosed in single or double quotes.\nReadline Key Bindings\nThe syntax for controlling key bindings in the\ninputrc\nfile is\nsimple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the\ntext of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound.\nThe key sequence may be specified in one of two ways: as a\nsymbolic key name, possibly with\nMeta-\nor\nControl-\nprefixes, or as\na key sequence composed of one or more characters enclosed in\ndouble quotes.  The key sequence and name are separated by a\ncolon.  There can be no whitespace between the name and the colon.\nWhen using the form\nkeyname\n:\nfunction-name\nor\nmacro\n,\nkeyname\nis the\nname of a key spelled out in English.  For example:\nControl-u: universal-argument\nMeta-Rubout: backward-kill-word\nControl-o: \"> output\"\nIn the above example,\nC-u\nis bound to the function\nuniversal-argument\n,\nM-DEL\nis bound to the function\nbackward-kill-word\n, and\nC-o\nis bound to run the macro expressed on\nthe right hand side (that is, to insert the text â> outputâ into\nthe line).\nIn the second form,\n\"keyseq\"\n:\nfunction-name\nor\nmacro\n,\nkeyseq\ndiffers from\nkeyname\nabove in that strings denoting an entire key\nsequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double\nquotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the\nfollowing example, but none of the symbolic character names are\nrecognized.\n\"\\C-u\": universal-argument\n\"\\C-x\\C-r\": re-read-init-file\n\"\\e[11~\": \"Function Key 1\"\nIn this example,\nC-u\nis again bound to the function\nuniversal-argument\n.\nC-x C-r\nis bound to the function\nre-read-init-file\n, and\nESC [ 1 1 ~\nis bound to insert the text\nâFunction Key 1â.\nThe full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when\nspecifying key sequences is\n\\C-\nA control prefix.\n\\M-\nAdding the meta prefix or converting the following\ncharacter to a meta character, as described below\nunder\nforce-meta-prefix\n.\n\\e\nAn escape character.\n\\\\\nBackslash.\n\\\"\nLiteral \", a double quote.\n\\'\nLiteral ', a single quote.\nIn addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set\nof backslash escapes is available:\n\\a\nalert (bell)\n\\b\nbackspace\n\\d\ndelete\n\\f\nform feed\n\\n\nnewline\n\\r\ncarriage return\n\\t\nhorizontal tab\n\\v\nvertical tab\n\\\nnnn\nThe eight-bit character whose value is the octal\nvalue\nnnn\n(one to three digits).\n\\x\nHH\nThe eight-bit character whose value is the\nhexadecimal value\nHH\n(one or two hex digits).\nWhen entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be\nused to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to\nbe a function name.  The backslash escapes described above are\nexpanded in the macro body.  Backslash quotes any other character\nin the macro text, including \" and '.\nBash\nwill display or modify the current\nreadline\nkey bindings with\nthe\nbind\nbuiltin command.  The\n-o emacs\nor\n-o vi\noptions to the\nset\nbuiltin (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow) change the editing\nmode during interactive use.\nReadline Variables\nReadline\nhas variables that can be used to further customize its\nbehavior.  A variable may be set in the\ninputrc\nfile with a\nstatement of the form\nset\nvariable-name value\nor using the\nbind\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nExcept where noted,\nreadline\nvariables can take the values\nOn\nor\nOff\n(without regard to case).  Unrecognized variable names are\nignored.  When\nreadline\nreads a variable value, empty or null\nvalues, âonâ (case-insensitive), and â1â are equivalent to\nOn\n.\nAll other values are equivalent to\nOff\n.\nThe\nbind -V\ncommand lists the current\nreadline\nvariable names and\nvalues (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).\nThe variables and their default values are:\nactive-region-start-color\nA string variable that controls the text color and\nbackground when displaying the text in the active region\n(see the description of\nenable-active-region\nbelow).  This\nstring must not take up any physical character positions on\nthe display, so it should consist only of terminal escape\nsequences.  It is output to the terminal before displaying\nthe text in the active region.  This variable is reset to\nthe default value whenever the terminal type changes.  The\ndefault value is the string that puts the terminal in\nstandout mode, as obtained from the terminal's terminfo\ndescription.  A sample value might be â\\e[01;33mâ.\nactive-region-end-color\nA string variable that âundoesâ the effects of\nactive-region-start-color\nand restores ânormalâ terminal\ndisplay appearance after displaying text in the active\nregion.  This string must not take up any physical\ncharacter positions on the display, so it should consist\nonly of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to the\nterminal after displaying the text in the active region.\nThis variable is reset to the default value whenever the\nterminal type changes.  The default value is the string\nthat restores the terminal from standout mode, as obtained\nfrom the terminal's terminfo description.  A sample value\nmight be â\\e[0mâ.\nbell-style (audible)\nControls what happens when\nreadline\nwants to ring the\nterminal bell.  If set to\nnone\n,\nreadline\nnever rings the\nbell.  If set to\nvisible\n,\nreadline\nuses a visible bell if\none is available.  If set to\naudible\n,\nreadline\nattempts to\nring the terminal's bell.\nbind-tty-special-chars (On)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nattempts to bind the control\ncharacters that are treated specially by the kernel's\nterminal driver to their\nreadline\nequivalents.  These\noverride the default\nreadline\nbindings described here.\nType âstty -aâ at a\nbash\nprompt to see your current\nterminal settings, including the special control characters\n(usually\ncchars\n).\nblink-matching-paren (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nattempts to briefly move the cursor\nto an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is\ninserted.\ncolored-completion-prefix (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, when listing completions,\nreadline\ndisplays\nthe common prefix of the set of possible completions using\na different color.  The color definitions are taken from\nthe value of the\nLS_COLORS\nenvironment variable.  If there\nis a color definition in\n$LS_COLORS\nfor the custom suffix\nâ.readline-colored-completion-prefixâ,\nreadline\nuses this\ncolor for the common prefix instead of its default.\ncolored-stats (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ndisplays possible completions using\ndifferent colors to indicate their file type.  The color\ndefinitions are taken from the value of the\nLS_COLORS\nenvironment variable.\ncomment-begin (\nâ\n#\nâ\n)\nThe string that the\nreadline insert-comment\ncommand\ninserts.  This command is bound to\nM-#\nin emacs mode and to\n#\nin vi command mode.\ncompletion-display-width (-1)\nThe number of screen columns used to display possible\nmatches when performing completion.  The value is ignored\nif it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen\nwidth.  A value of 0 causes matches to be displayed one per\nline.  The default value is -1.\ncompletion-ignore-case (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nperforms filename matching and\ncompletion in a case-insensitive fashion.\ncompletion-map-case (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, and\ncompletion-ignore-case\nis enabled,\nreadline\ntreats hyphens (\n-\n) and underscores (\n_\n) as\nequivalent when performing case-insensitive filename\nmatching and completion.\ncompletion-prefix-display-length\n(0)\nThe maximum length in characters of the common prefix of a\nlist of possible completions that is displayed without\nmodification.  When set to a value greater than zero,\nreadline\nreplaces common prefixes longer than this value\nwith an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.  If\na completion begins with a period, and\neadline\nis\ncompleting filenames, it uses three underscores instead of\nan ellipsis.\ncompletion-query-items (100)\nThis determines when the user is queried about viewing the\nnumber of possible completions generated by the\npossible-completions\ncommand.  It may be set to any integer\nvalue greater than or equal to zero.  If the number of\npossible completions is greater than or equal to the value\nof this variable,\nreadline\nasks whether or not the user\nwishes to view them; otherwise\nreadline\nsimply lists them\non the terminal.  A zero value means\nreadline\nshould never\nask; negative values are treated as zero.\nconvert-meta (On)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nconverts characters it reads that\nhave the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by\nclearing the eighth bit and prefixing it with an escape\ncharacter (converting the character to have the meta\nprefix).  The default is\nOn\n, but\nreadline\nsets it to\nOff\nif\nthe locale contains characters whose encodings may include\nbytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent\non the\nLC_CTYPE\nlocale category, and may change if the\nlocale changes.  This variable also affects key bindings;\nsee the description of\nforce-meta-prefix\nbelow.\ndisable-completion (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ninhibits word completion.\nCompletion characters are inserted into the line as if they\nhad been mapped to\nself-insert\n.\necho-control-characters (On)\nWhen set to\nOn\n, on operating systems that indicate they\nsupport it,\nreadline\nechoes a character corresponding to a\nsignal generated from the keyboard.\nediting-mode (emacs)\nControls whether\nreadline\nuses a set of key bindings\nsimilar to\nEmacs\nor\nvi\n.\nediting-mode\ncan be set to either\nemacs\nor\nvi\n.\nemacs-mode-string (@)\nIf the\nshow-mode-in-prompt\nvariable is enabled, this string\nis displayed immediately before the last line of the\nprimary prompt when emacs editing mode is active.  The\nvalue is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set\nof meta- and control- prefixes and backslash escape\nsequences is available.  The \\1 and \\2 escapes begin and\nend sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used\nto embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.\nenable-active-region (On)\nWhen this variable is set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nallows certain\ncommands to designate the region as\nactive\n.  When the\nregion is active,\nreadline\nhighlights the text in the\nregion using the value of the\nactive-region-start-color\nvariable, which defaults to the string that enables the\nterminal's standout mode.  The active region shows the text\ninserted by bracketed-paste and any matching text found by\nincremental and non-incremental history searches.\nenable-bracketed-paste (On)\nWhen set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nconfigures the terminal to insert\neach paste into the editing buffer as a single string of\ncharacters, instead of treating each character as if it had\nbeen read from the keyboard.  This is called\nbracketed-paste mode\n; it prevents\nreadline\nfrom executing\nany editing commands bound to key sequences appearing in\nthe pasted text.\nenable-keypad (Off)\nWhen set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ntries  to enable the application\nkeypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable\nthe arrow keys.\nenable-meta-key (On)\nWhen set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ntries to enable any meta modifier\nkey the terminal claims to support.  On many terminals, the\nMeta key is used to send eight-bit characters; this\nvariable checks for the terminal capability that indicates\nthe terminal can enable and disable a mode that sets the\neighth bit of a character (0200) if the Meta key is held\ndown when the character is typed (a meta character).\nexpand-tilde (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nperforms tilde expansion when it\nattempts word completion.\nforce-meta-prefix (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nmodifies its behavior when binding\nkey sequences containing \\M- or Meta- (see\nKey Bindings\nabove) by converting a key sequence of the form \\M-\nC\nor\nMeta-\nC\nto the two-character sequence\nESC\nC\n(adding the meta\nprefix).  If\nforce-meta-prefix\nis set to\nOff\n(the default),\nreadline\nuses the value of the\nconvert-meta\nvariable to\ndetermine whether to perform this conversion: if\nconvert-meta\nis\nOn\n,\nreadline\nperforms the conversion\ndescribed above; if it is\nOff\n,\nreadline\nconverts\nC\nto a\nmeta character by setting the eighth bit (0200).\nhistory-preserve-point (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, the history code attempts to place point at\nthe same location on each history line retrieved with\nprevious-history\nor\nnext-history\n.\nhistory-size (unset)\nSet the maximum number of history entries saved in the\nhistory list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries\nare deleted and no new entries are saved.  If set to a\nvalue less than zero, the number of history entries is not\nlimited.  By default,\nbash\nsets the maximum number of\nhistory entries to the value of the\nHISTSIZE\nshell\nvariable.  Setting\nhistory-size\nto a non-numeric value will\nset the maximum number of history entries to 500.\nhorizontal-scroll-mode (Off)\nSetting this variable to\nOn\nmakes\nreadline\nuse a single\nline for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a\nsingle screen line when it becomes longer than the screen\nwidth rather than wrapping to a new line.  This setting is\nautomatically enabled for terminals of height 1.\ninput-meta (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nenables eight-bit input (that is, it\ndoes not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads),\nregardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The\ndefault is\nOff\n, but\nreadline\nsets it to\nOn\nif the locale\ncontains characters whose encodings may include bytes with\nthe eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent on the\nLC_CTYPE\nlocale category, and its value may change if the\nlocale changes.  The name\nmeta-flag\nis a synonym for\ninput-meta\n.\nisearch-terminators (\nâ\nC-[C-j\nâ\n)\nThe string of characters that should terminate an\nincremental search without subsequently executing the\ncharacter as a command.  If this variable has not been\ngiven a value, the characters\nESC\nand\nC-j\nterminate an\nincremental search.\nkeymap (emacs)\nSet the current\nreadline\nkeymap.  The set of valid keymap\nnames is\nemacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,\nvi-command\n, and\nvi-insert\n.\nvi\nis equivalent to\nvi-command\n;\nemacs\nis equivalent to\nemacs-standard\n.  The default value\nis\nemacs\n; the value of\nediting-mode\nalso affects the\ndefault keymap.\nkeyseq-timeout (500)\nSpecifies the duration\nreadline\nwill wait for a character\nwhen reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a\ncomplete key sequence using the input read so far, or can\ntake additional input to complete a longer key sequence).\nIf\nreadline\ndoes not receive any input within the timeout,\nit uses the shorter but complete key sequence.  The value\nis specified in milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that\nreadline\nwill wait one second for additional input.  If\nthis variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero,\nor to a non-numeric value,\nreadline\nwaits until another key\nis pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.\nmark-directories (On)\nIf set to\nOn\n, completed directory names have a slash\nappended.\nmark-modified-lines (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ndisplays history lines that have\nbeen modified with a preceding asterisk (\n*\n).\nmark-symlinked-directories (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, completed names which are symbolic links to\ndirectories have a slash appended, subject to the value of\nmark-directories\n.\nmatch-hidden-files (On)\nThis variable, when set to\nOn\n, forces\nreadline\nto match\nfiles whose names begin with a â.â  (hidden files) when\nperforming filename completion.  If set to\nOff\n, the user\nmust include the leading â.â  in the filename to be\ncompleted.\nmenu-complete-display-prefix (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, menu completion displays the common prefix of\nthe list of possible completions (which may be empty)\nbefore cycling through the list.\noutput-meta (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ndisplays characters with the eighth\nbit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape\nsequence.  The default is\nOff\n, but\nreadline\nsets it to\nOn\nif the locale contains characters whose encodings may\ninclude bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable is\ndependent on the\nLC_CTYPE\nlocale category, and its value\nmay change if the locale changes.\npage-completions (On)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nuses an internal pager resembling\nmore(1)\nto display a screenful of possible completions at a\ntime.\nprefer-visible-bell\nSee\nbell-style\n.\nprint-completions-horizontally (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\ndisplays completions with matches\nsorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down\nthe screen.\nrevert-all-at-newline (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nwill undo all changes to history\nlines before returning when executing\naccept-line\n.  By\ndefault, history lines may be modified and retain\nindividual undo lists across calls to\nreadline\n.\nsearch-ignore-case (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n,\nreadline\nperforms incremental and non-\nincremental history list searches in a case-insensitive\nfashion.\nshow-all-if-ambiguous (Off)\nThis alters the default behavior of the completion\nfunctions.  If set to\nOn\n, words which have more than one\npossible completion cause the matches to be listed\nimmediately instead of ringing the bell.\nshow-all-if-unmodified (Off)\nThis alters the default behavior of the completion\nfunctions in a fashion similar to\nshow-all-if-ambiguous\n.\nIf set to\nOn\n, words which have more than one possible\ncompletion without any possible partial completion (the\npossible completions don't share a common prefix) cause the\nmatches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the\nbell.\nshow-mode-in-prompt (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, add a string to the beginning of the prompt\nindicating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi\ninsertion.  The mode strings are user-settable (e.g.,\nemacs-mode-string\n).\nskip-completed-text (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, this alters the default completion behavior\nwhen inserting a single match into the line.  It's only\nactive when performing completion in the middle of a word.\nIf enabled,\nreadline\ndoes not insert characters from the\ncompletion that match characters after point in the word\nbeing completed, so portions of the word following the\ncursor are not duplicated.\nvi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))\nIf the\nshow-mode-in-prompt\nvariable is enabled, this string\nis displayed immediately before the last line of the\nprimary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in\ncommand mode.  The value is expanded like a key binding, so\nthe standard set of meta- and control- prefixes and\nbackslash escape sequences is available.  The \\1 and \\2\nescapes begin and end sequences of non-printing characters,\nwhich can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into\nthe mode string.\nvi-ins-mode-string ((ins))\nIf the\nshow-mode-in-prompt\nvariable is enabled, this string\nis displayed immediately before the last line of the\nprimary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in\ninsertion mode.  The value is expanded like a key binding,\nso the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes and\nbackslash escape sequences is available.  The \\1 and \\2\nescapes begin and end sequences of non-printing characters,\nwhich can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into\nthe mode string.\nvisible-stats (Off)\nIf set to\nOn\n, a character denoting a file's type as\nreported by\nstat(2)\nis appended to the filename when\nlisting possible completions.\nReadline Conditional Constructs\nReadline\nimplements a facility similar in spirit to the\nconditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which\nallows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the\nresult of tests.  There are four parser directives available.\n$if\nThe\n$if\nconstruct allows bindings to be made based on the\nediting mode, the terminal being used, or the application\nusing\nreadline\n.  The text of the test, after any comparison\noperator, extends to the end of the line; unless otherwise\nnoted, no characters are required to isolate it.\nmode\nThe\nmode=\nform of the\n$if\ndirective is used to test\nwhether\nreadline\nis in emacs or vi mode.  This may\nbe used in conjunction with the\nset keymap\ncommand,\nfor instance, to set bindings in the\nemacs-standard\nand\nemacs-ctlx\nkeymaps only if\nreadline\nis starting\nout in emacs mode.\nterm\nThe\nterm=\nform may be used to include terminal-\nspecific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key\nsequences output by the terminal's function keys.\nThe word on the right side of the\n=\nis tested\nagainst both the full name of the terminal and the\nportion of the terminal name before the first\n-\n.\nThis allows\nxterm\nto match both\nxterm\nand\nxterm-256color\n, for instance.\nversion\nThe\nversion\ntest may be used to perform comparisons\nagainst specific\nreadline\nversions.  The\nversion\nexpands to the current\nreadline\nversion.  The set of\ncomparison operators includes\n=\n, (and\n==\n),\n!=\n,\n<=\n,\n>=\n,\n<\n, and\n>\n.  The version number supplied on the\nright side of the operator consists of a major\nversion number, an optional decimal point, and an\noptional minor version (e.g.,\n7.1\n).  If the minor\nversion is omitted, it defaults to\n0\n.  The operator\nmay be separated from the string\nversion\nand from\nthe version number argument by whitespace.\napplication\nThe\napplication\nconstruct is used to include\napplication-specific settings.  Each program using\nthe\nreadline\nlibrary sets the\napplication name\n, and\nan initialization file can test for a particular\nvalue.  This could be used to bind key sequences to\nfunctions useful for a specific program.  For\ninstance, the following command adds a key sequence\nthat quotes the current or previous word in\nbash\n:\n$if\nBash\n# Quote the current or previous word\n\"\\C-xq\": \"\\eb\\\"\\ef\\\"\"\n$endif\nvariable\nThe\nvariable\nconstruct provides simple equality\ntests for\nreadline\nvariables and values.  The\npermitted comparison operators are\n=\n,\n==\n, and\n!=\n.\nThe variable name must be separated from the\ncomparison operator by whitespace; the operator may\nbe separated from the value on the right hand side\nby whitespace.  String and boolean variables may be\ntested.  Boolean variables must be tested against\nthe values\non\nand\noff\n.\n$else\nCommands in this branch of the\n$if\ndirective are executed\nif the test fails.\n$endif\nThis command, as seen in the previous example, terminates\nan\n$if\ncommand.\n$include\nThis directive takes a single filename as an argument and\nreads commands and key bindings from that file.  For\nexample, the following directive would read\n/etc/inputrc\n:\n$include\n/etc/inputrc\nSearching\nReadline\nprovides commands for searching through the command\nhistory (see\nHISTORY\nbelow) for lines containing a specified\nstring.  There are two search modes:\nincremental\nand\nnon-\nincremental\n.\nIncremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the\nsearch string.  As each character of the search string is typed,\nreadline\ndisplays the next entry from the history matching the\nstring typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many\ncharacters as needed to find the desired history entry.  When\nusing emacs editing mode, type\nC-r\nto search backward in the\nhistory for a particular string.  Typing\nC-s\nsearches forward\nthrough the history.  The characters present in the value of the\nisearch-terminators\nvariable are used to terminate an incremental\nsearch.  If that variable has not been assigned a value,\nESC\nand\nC-j\nterminate an incremental search.\nC-g\naborts an incremental\nsearch and restores the original line.  When the search is\nterminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes\nthe current line.\nTo find other matching entries in the history list, type\nC-r\nor\nC-s\nas appropriate.  This searches backward or forward in the\nhistory for the next entry matching the search string typed so\nfar.  Any other key sequence bound to a\nreadline\ncommand\nterminates the search and executes that command.  For instance, a\nnewline terminates the search and accepts the line, thereby\nexecuting the command from the history list.  A movement command\nwill terminate the search, make the last line found the current\nline, and begin editing.\nReadline\nremembers the last incremental search string.  If two\nC-r\ns are typed without any intervening characters defining a new\nsearch string,\nreadline\nuses any remembered search string.\nNon-incremental searches read the entire search string before\nstarting to search for matching history entries.  The search\nstring may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the\ncurrent line.\nReadline Command Names\nThe following is a list of the names of the commands and the\ndefault key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names\nwithout an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.\nIn the following descriptions,\npoint\nrefers to the current cursor\nposition, and\nmark\nrefers to a cursor position saved by the\nset-mark\ncommand.  The text between the point and mark is referred\nto as the\nregion\n.\nReadline\nhas the concept of an\nactive region\n:\nwhen the region is active,\nreadline\nredisplay highlights the\nregion using the value of the\nactive-region-start-color\nvariable.\nThe\nenable-active-region readline\nvariable turns this on and off.\nSeveral commands set the region to active; those are noted below.\nCommands for Moving\nbeginning-of-line (C-a)\nMove to the start of the current line.  This may also be\nbound to the Home key on some keyboards.\nend-of-line (C-e)\nMove to the end of the line.  This may also be bound to the\nEnd key on some keyboards.\nforward-char (C-f)\nMove forward a character.  This may also be bound to the\nright arrow key on some keyboards.\nbackward-char (C-b)\nMove back a character.  This may also be bound to the left\narrow key on some keyboards.\nforward-word (M-f)\nMove forward to the end of the next word.  Words are\ncomposed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).\nbackward-word (M-b)\nMove back to the start of the current or previous word.\nWords are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and\ndigits).\nshell-forward-word (M-C-f)\nMove forward to the end of the next word.  Words are\ndelimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.\nshell-backward-word (M-C-b)\nMove back to the start of the current or previous word.\nWords are delimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.\nprevious-screen-line\nAttempt to move point to the same physical screen column on\nthe previous physical screen line.  This will not have the\ndesired effect if the current\nreadline\nline does not take\nup more than one physical line or if point is not greater\nthan the length of the prompt plus the screen width.\nnext-screen-line\nAttempt to move point to the same physical screen column on\nthe next physical screen line.  This will not have the\ndesired effect if the current\nreadline\nline does not take\nup more than one physical line or if the length of the\ncurrent\nreadline\nline is not greater than the length of the\nprompt plus the screen width.\nclear-display (M-C-l)\nClear the screen and, if possible, the terminal's\nscrollback buffer, then redraw the current line, leaving\nthe current line at the top of the screen.\nclear-screen (C-l)\nClear the screen, then redraw the current line, leaving the\ncurrent line at the top of the screen.  With a numeric\nargument, refresh the current line without clearing the\nscreen.\nredraw-current-line\nRefresh the current line.\nCommands for Manipulating the History\naccept-line (Newline, Return)\nAccept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this\nline is non-empty, add it to the history list according to\nthe state of the\nHISTCONTROL\nand\nHISTIGNORE\nvariables.  If\nthe line is a modified history line, restore the history\nline to its original state.\nprevious-history (C-p)\nFetch the previous command from the history list, moving\nback in the list.  This may also be bound to the up arrow\nkey on some keyboards.\nnext-history (C-n)\nFetch the next command from the history list, moving\nforward in the list.  This may also be bound to the down\narrow key on some keyboards.\nbeginning-of-history (M-<)\nMove to the first line in the history.\nend-of-history (M->)\nMove to the end of the input history, i.e., the line\ncurrently being entered.\noperate-and-get-next (C-o)\nAccept the current line for execution as if a newline had\nbeen entered, and fetch the next line relative to the\ncurrent line from the history for editing.  A numeric\nargument, if supplied, specifies the history entry to use\ninstead of the current line.\nfetch-history\nWith a numeric argument, fetch that entry from the history\nlist and make it the current line.  Without an argument,\nmove back to the first entry in the history list.\nreverse-search-history (C-r)\nSearch backward starting at the current line and moving\nâupâ through the history as necessary.  This is an\nincremental search.  This command sets the region to the\nmatched text and activates the region.\nforward-search-history (C-s)\nSearch forward starting at the current line and moving\nâdownâ through the history as necessary.  This is an\nincremental search.  This command sets the region to the\nmatched text and activates the region.\nnon-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)\nSearch backward through the history starting at the current\nline using a non-incremental search for a string supplied\nby the user.  The search string may match anywhere in a\nhistory line.\nnon-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)\nSearch forward through the history using a non-incremental\nsearch for a string supplied by the user.  The search\nstring may match anywhere in a history line.\nhistory-search-backward\nSearch backward through the history for the string of\ncharacters between the start of the current line and the\npoint.  The search string must match at the beginning of a\nhistory line.  This is a non-incremental search.  This may\nbe bound to the Page Up key on some keyboards.\nhistory-search-forward\nSearch forward through the history for the string of\ncharacters between the start of the current line and the\npoint.  The search string must match at the beginning of a\nhistory line.  This is a non-incremental search.  This may\nbe bound to the Page Down key on some keyboards.\nhistory-substring-search-backward\nSearch backward through the history for the string of\ncharacters between the start of the current line and the\npoint.  The search string may match anywhere in a history\nline.  This is a non-incremental search.\nhistory-substring-search-forward\nSearch forward through the history for the string of\ncharacters between the start of the current line and the\npoint.  The search string may match anywhere in a history\nline.  This is a non-incremental search.\nyank-nth-arg (M-C-y)\nInsert the first argument to the previous command (usually\nthe second word on the previous line) at point.  With an\nargument\nn\n, insert the\nn\nth word from the previous command\n(the words in the previous command begin with word 0).  A\nnegative argument inserts the\nn\nth word from the end of the\nprevious command.  Once the argument\nn\nis computed, this\nuses the history expansion facilities to extract the\nn\nth\nword, as if the â!\nn\nâ history expansion had been specified.\nyank-last-arg (M-., M-_)\nInsert the last argument to the previous command (the last\nword of the previous history entry).  With a numeric\nargument, behave exactly like\nyank-nth-arg\n.  Successive\ncalls to\nyank-last-arg\nmove back through the history list,\ninserting the last word (or the word specified by the\nargument to the first call) of each line in turn.  Any\nnumeric argument supplied to these successive calls\ndetermines the direction to move through the history.  A\nnegative argument switches the direction through the\nhistory (back or forward).  This uses the history expansion\nfacilities to extract the last word, as if the â!$â history\nexpansion had been specified.\nshell-expand-line (M-C-e)\nExpand the line by performing shell word expansions.  This\nperforms alias and history expansion,\n$\n'\nstring\n' and\n$\n\"\nstring\n\" quoting, tilde expansion, parameter and variable\nexpansion, arithmetic expansion, command and process\nsubstitution, word splitting, and quote removal.  An\nexplicit argument suppresses command and process\nsubstitution.  See\nHISTORY EXPANSION\nbelow for a\ndescription of history expansion.\nhistory-expand-line (M-^)\nPerform history expansion on the current line.  See\nHISTORY\nEXPANSION\nbelow for a description of history expansion.\nmagic-space\nPerform history expansion on the current line and insert a\nspace.  See\nHISTORY EXPANSION\nbelow for a description of\nhistory expansion.\nalias-expand-line\nPerform alias expansion on the current line.  See\nALIASES\nabove for a description of alias expansion.\nhistory-and-alias-expand-line\nPerform history and alias expansion on the current line.\ninsert-last-argument (M-., M-_)\nA synonym for\nyank-last-arg\n.\nedit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)\nInvoke an editor on the current command line, and execute\nthe result as shell commands.\nBash\nattempts to invoke\n$VISUAL\n,\n$EDITOR\n, and\nemacs\nas the editor, in that order.\nCommands for Changing Text\nend-of-file\n(usually C-d)\nThe character indicating end-of-file as set, for example,\nby\nstty(1)\n.  If this character is read when there are no\ncharacters on the line, and point is at the beginning of\nthe line,\nreadline\ninterprets it as the end of input and\nreturns\nEOF\n.\ndelete-char (C-d)\nDelete the character at point.  If this function is bound\nto the same character as the tty\nEOF\ncharacter, as\nC-d\ncommonly is, see above for the effects.  This may also be\nbound to the Delete key on some keyboards.\nbackward-delete-char (Rubout)\nDelete the character behind the cursor.  When given a\nnumeric argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.\nforward-backward-delete-char\nDelete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is\nat the end of the line, in which case the character behind\nthe cursor is deleted.\nquoted-insert (C-q, C-v)\nAdd the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is\nhow to insert characters like\nC-q\n, for example.\ntab-insert (C-v TAB)\nInsert a tab character.\nself-insert (a, b, A, 1, !,\n...\n)\nInsert the character typed.\nbracketed-paste-begin\nThis function is intended to be bound to the âbracketed\npasteâ escape sequence sent by some terminals, and such a\nbinding is assigned by default.  It allows\nreadline\nto\ninsert the pasted text as a single unit without treating\neach character as if it had been read from the keyboard.\nThe pasted characters are inserted as if each one was bound\nto\nself-insert\ninstead of executing any editing commands.\nBracketed paste sets the region to the inserted text and\nactivates the region.\ntranspose-chars (C-t)\nDrag the character before point forward over the character\nat point, moving point forward as well.  If point is at the\nend of the line, then this transposes the two characters\nbefore point.  Negative arguments have no effect.\ntranspose-words (M-t)\nDrag the word before point past the word after point,\nmoving point past that word as well.  If point is at the\nend of the line, this transposes the last two words on the\nline.\nshell-transpose-words (M-C-t)\nDrag the word before point past the word after point,\nmoving point past that word as well.  If the insertion\npoint is at the end of the line, this transposes the last\ntwo words on the line.  Word boundaries are the same as\nshell-forward-word\nand\nshell-backward-word\n.\nupcase-word (M-u)\nUppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative\nargument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move\npoint.\ndowncase-word (M-l)\nLowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative\nargument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move\npoint.\ncapitalize-word (M-c)\nCapitalize the current (or following) word.  With a\nnegative argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not\nmove point.\noverwrite-mode\nToggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric\nargument, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit\nnon-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.\nThis command affects only\nemacs\nmode;\nvi\nmode does\noverwrite differently.  Each call to\nreadline()\nstarts in\ninsert mode.\nIn overwrite mode, characters bound to\nself-insert\nreplace\nthe text at point rather than pushing the text to the\nright.  Characters bound to\nbackward-delete-char\nreplace\nthe character before point with a space.  By default, this\ncommand is unbound, but may be bound to the Insert key on\nsome keyboards.\nKilling and Yanking\nkill-line (C-k)\nKill the text from point to the end of the current line.\nWith a negative numeric argument, kill backward from the\ncursor to the beginning of the line.\nbackward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)\nKill backward to the beginning of the current line.  With a\nnegative numeric argument, kill forward from the cursor to\nthe end of the line.\nunix-line-discard (C-u)\nKill backward from point to the beginning of the line,\nsaving the killed text on the kill-ring.\nkill-whole-line\nKill all characters on the current line, no matter where\npoint is.\nkill-word (M-d)\nKill from point to the end of the current word, or if\nbetween words, to the end of the next word.  Word\nboundaries are the same as those used by\nforward-word\n.\nbackward-kill-word (M-Rubout)\nKill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same\nas those used by\nbackward-word\n.\nshell-kill-word (M-C-d)\nKill from point to the end of the current word, or if\nbetween words, to the end of the next word.  Word\nboundaries are the same as those used by\nshell-forward-word\n.\nshell-backward-kill-word\nKill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same\nas those used by\nshell-backward-word\n.\nunix-word-rubout (C-w)\nKill the word behind point, using white space as a word\nboundary, saving the killed text on the kill-ring.\nunix-filename-rubout\nKill the word behind point, using white space and the slash\ncharacter as the word boundaries, saving the killed text on\nthe kill-ring.\ndelete-horizontal-space (M-\\)\nDelete all spaces and tabs around point.\nkill-region\nKill the text in the current region.\ncopy-region-as-kill\nCopy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can\nbe yanked immediately.\ncopy-backward-word\nCopy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word\nboundaries are the same as\nbackward-word\n.\ncopy-forward-word\nCopy the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word\nboundaries are the same as\nforward-word\n.\nyank (C-y)\nYank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.\nyank-pop (M-y)\nRotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works\nfollowing\nyank\nor\nyank-pop\n.\nNumeric Arguments\ndigit-argument (M-0, M-1,\n...\n, M--)\nAdd this digit to the argument already accumulating, or\nstart a new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.\nuniversal-argument\nThis is another way to specify an argument.  If this\ncommand is followed by one or more digits, optionally with\na leading minus sign, those digits define the argument.  If\nthe command is followed by digits, executing\nuniversal-argument\nagain ends the numeric argument, but is\notherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this command is\nimmediately followed by a character that is neither a digit\nnor minus sign, the argument count for the next command is\nmultiplied by four.  The argument count is initially one,\nso executing this function the first time makes the\nargument count four, a second time makes the argument count\nsixteen, and so on.\nCompleting\ncomplete (TAB)\nAttempt to perform completion on the text before point.\nBash\nattempts completion by first checking for any\nprogrammable completions for the command word (see\nProgrammable Completion\nbelow), otherwise treating the text\nas a variable (if the text begins with\n$\n), username (if the\ntext begins with\n~\n), hostname (if the text begins with\n@\n),\nor command (including aliases, functions, and builtins) in\nturn.  If none of these produces a match, it falls back to\nfilename completion.\npossible-completions (M-?)\nList the possible completions of the text before point.\nWhen displaying completions,\nreadline\nsets the number of\ncolumns used for display to the value of\ncompletion-\ndisplay-width\n, the value of the shell variable\nCOLUMNS\n, or\nthe screen width, in that order.\ninsert-completions (M-*)\nInsert all completions of the text before point that would\nhave been generated by\npossible-completions\n, separated by a\nspace.\nmenu-complete\nSimilar to\ncomplete\n, but replaces the word to be completed\nwith a single match from the list of possible completions.\nRepeatedly executing\nmenu-complete\nsteps through the list\nof possible completions, inserting each match in turn.  At\nthe end of the list of completions,\nmenu-complete\nrings the\nbell (subject to the setting of\nbell-style\n) and restores\nthe original text.  An argument of\nn\nmoves\nn\npositions\nforward in the list of matches; a negative argument moves\nbackward through the list.  This command is intended to be\nbound to\nTAB\n, but is unbound by default.\nmenu-complete-backward\nIdentical to\nmenu-complete\n, but moves backward through the\nlist of possible completions, as if\nmenu-complete\nhad been\ngiven a negative argument.  This command is unbound by\ndefault.\nexport-completions\nPerform completion on the word before point as described\nabove and write the list of possible completions to\nreadline\n's output stream using the following format,\nwriting information on separate lines:\nâ¢      the number of matches\nN\n;\nâ¢      the word being completed;\nâ¢\nS\n:\nE\n, where\nS\nand\nE\nare the start and end offsets of\nthe word in the\nreadline\nline buffer; then\nâ¢      each match, one per line\nIf there are no matches, the first line will be â0â, and\nthis command does not print any output after the\nS\n:\nE\n.  If\nthere is only a single match, this prints a single line\ncontaining it.  If there is more than one match, this\nprints the common prefix of the matches, which may be\nempty, on the first line after the\nS\n:\nE\n, then the matches on\nsubsequent lines.  In this case,\nN\nwill include the first\nline with the common prefix.\nThe user or application should be able to accommodate the\npossibility of a blank line.  The intent is that the user\nor application reads\nN\nlines after the line containing\nS\n:\nE\nto obtain the match list.  This command is unbound by\ndefault.\ndelete-char-or-list\nDeletes the character under the cursor if not at the\nbeginning or end of the line (like\ndelete-char\n).

If a compspec has been\ndefined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the\nlist of possible completions for the word.  If the command word is\nthe empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an\nempty line),\nbash\nuses any compspec defined with the\n-E\noption to\ncomplete\n.  The\n-I\noption to\ncomplete\nindicates that the command\nword is the first non-assignment word on the line, or after a\ncommand delimiter such as\n;\nor\n|\n.  This usually indicates command\nname completion.\nIf the command word is a full pathname,\nbash\nsearches for a\ncompspec for the full pathname first.  If there is no compspec for\nthe full pathname,\nbash\nattempts to find a compspec for the\nportion following the final slash.  If those searches do not\nresult in a compspec, or if there is no compspec for the command\nword,\nbash\nuses any compspec defined with the\n-D\noption to\ncomplete\nas the default.  If there is no default compspec,\nbash\nperforms alias expansion on the command word as a final resort,\nand attempts to find a compspec for the command word resulting\nfrom any successful expansion.\nIf a compspec is not found,\nbash\nperforms its default completion\nas described above under\nCompleting\n.  Otherwise, once a compspec\nhas been found,\nbash\nuses it to generate the list of matching\nwords.\nFirst,\nbash\nperforms the\nactions\nspecified by the compspec.  This\nonly returns matches which are prefixes of the word being\ncompleted.  When the\n-f\nor\n-d\noption is used for filename or\ndirectory name completion,\nbash\nuses the shell variable\nFIGNORE\nto\nfilter the matches.\nNext, programmable completion generates matches specified by a\npathname expansion pattern supplied as an argument to the\n-G\noption.  The words generated by the pattern need not match the\nword being completed.\nBash\nuses the\nFIGNORE\nvariable to filter\nthe matches, but does not use the\nGLOBIGNORE\nshell variable.\nNext, completion considers the string specified as the argument to\nthe\n-W\noption.  The string is first split using the characters in\nthe\nIFS\nspecial variable as delimiters.  This honors shell quoting\nwithin the string, in order to provide a mechanism for the words\nto contain shell metacharacters or characters in the value of\nIFS\n.\nEach word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion,\nparameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and\narithmetic expansion, as described above under\nEXPANSION\n.  The\nresults are split using the rules described above under\nWord\nSplitting\n.  The results of the expansion are prefix-matched\nagainst the word being completed, and the matching words become\npossible completions.\nAfter these matches have been generated,\nbash\nexecutes any shell\nfunction or command specified with the\n-F\nand\n-C\noptions.  When\nthe command or function is invoked,\nbash\nassigns values to the\nCOMP_LINE\n,\nCOMP_POINT\n,\nCOMP_KEY\n, and\nCOMP_TYPE\nvariables as\ndescribed above under\nShell Variables\n.  If a shell function is\nbeing invoked,\nbash\nalso sets the\nCOMP_WORDS\nand\nCOMP_CWORD\nvariables.  When the function or command is invoked, the first\nargument (\n$1\n) is the name of the command whose arguments are being\ncompleted, the second argument (\n$2\n) is the word being completed,\nand the third argument (\n$3\n) is the word preceding the word being\ncompleted on the current command line.  There is no filtering of\nthe generated completions against the word being completed; the\nfunction or command has complete freedom in generating the matches\nand they do not need to match a prefix of the word.\nAny function specified with\n-F\nis invoked first.  The function may\nuse any of the shell facilities, including the\ncompgen\nand\ncompopt\nbuiltins described below, to generate the matches.  It must put\nthe possible completions in the\nCOMPREPLY\narray variable, one per\narray element.\nNext, any command specified with the\n-C\noption is invoked in an\nenvironment equivalent to command substitution.  It should print a\nlist of completions, one per line, to the standard output.\nBackslash will escape a newline, if necessary.  These are added to\nthe set of possible completions.\nAfter generating all of the possible completions,\nbash\napplies any\nfilter specified with the\n-X\noption to the completions in the\nlist.  The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a\n&\nin the pattern is replaced with the text of the word being\ncompleted.  A literal\n&\nmay be escaped with a backslash; the\nbackslash is removed before attempting a match.  Any completion\nthat matches the pattern is removed from the list.  A leading\n!\nnegates the pattern; in this case\nbash\nremoves any completion that\ndoes not match the pattern.  If the\nnocasematch\nshell option is\nenabled,\nbash\nperforms the match without regard to the case of\nalphabetic characters.\nFinally, programmable completion adds any prefix and suffix\nspecified with the\n-P\nand\n-S\noptions, respectively, to each\ncompletion, and returns the result to\nreadline\nas the list of\npossible completions.\nIf the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and\nthe\n-o dirnames\noption was supplied to\ncomplete\nwhen the compspec\nwas defined,\nbash\nattempts directory name completion.\nIf the\n-o plusdirs\noption was supplied to\ncomplete\nwhen the\ncompspec was defined,\nbash\nattempts directory name completion and\nadds any matches to the set of possible completions.\nBy default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is\nreturned to the completion code as the full set of possible\ncompletions.  The default\nbash\ncompletions and the\nreadline\ndefault of filename completion are disabled.  If the\n-o\nbashdefault\noption was supplied to\ncomplete\nwhen the compspec was\ndefined, and the compspec generates no matches,\nbash\nattempts its\ndefault completions.  If the compspec and, if attempted, the\ndefault\nbash\ncompletions generate no matches, and the\n-o default\noption was supplied to\ncomplete\nwhen the compspec was defined,\nprogrammable completion performs\nreadline\n's default completion.\nThe options supplied to\ncomplete\nand\ncompopt\ncan control how\nreadline\ntreats the completions.  For instance, the\n-o fullquote\noption tells\nreadline\nto quote the matches as if they were\nfilenames.  See the description of\ncomplete\nbelow for details.\nWhen a compspec indicates that it wants directory name completion,\nthe programmable completion functions force\nreadline\nto append a\nslash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories,\nsubject to the value of the\nmark-directories readline\nvariable,\nregardless of the setting of the\nmark-symlinked-directories\nreadline\nvariable.\nThere is some support for dynamically modifying completions.  This\nis most useful when used in combination with a default completion\nspecified with\ncomplete -D\n.  It's possible for shell functions\nexecuted as completion functions to indicate that completion\nshould be retried by returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell\nfunction returns 124, and changes the compspec associated with the\ncommand on which completion is being attempted (supplied as the\nfirst argument when the function is executed), programmable\ncompletion restarts from the beginning, with an attempt to find a\nnew compspec for that command.  This can be used to build a set of\ncompletions dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than\nloading them all at once.\nFor instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each\nkept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the\nfollowing default completion function would load completions\ndynamically:\n_completion_loader()\n{\n. \"/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh\" \\\n>/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124\n}\ncomplete -D -F _completion_loader \\\n-o bashdefault -o default\nHISTORY\ntop\nWhen the\n-o history\noption to the\nset\nbuiltin is enabled, the\nshell provides access to the\ncommand history\n, the list of commands\npreviously typed.  The value of the\nHISTSIZE\nvariable is used as\nthe number of commands to save in a history list: the shell saves\nthe text of the last\nHISTSIZE\ncommands (default 500).  The shell\nstores each command in the history list prior to parameter and\nvariable expansion (see\nEXPANSION\nabove) but after history\nexpansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell\nvariables\nHISTIGNORE\nand\nHISTCONTROL\n.\nOn startup,\nbash\ninitializes the history list by reading history\nentries from the file named by the\nHISTFILE\nvariable (default\n~/.bash_history\n).  That file is referred to as the\nhistory file\n.\nThe history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more\nthan the number of history entries specified by the value of the\nHISTFILESIZE\nvariable.  If\nHISTFILESIZE\nis unset, or set to null,\na non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the\nhistory file is not truncated.\nWhen the history file is read, lines beginning with the history\ncomment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted\nas timestamps for the following history line.  These timestamps\nare optionally displayed depending on the value of the\nHISTTIMEFORMAT\nvariable.  When present, history timestamps delimit\nhistory entries, making multi-line entries possible.\nWhen a shell with history enabled exits,\nbash\ncopies the last\n$HISTSIZE\nentries from the history list to\n$HISTFILE\n.  If the\nhistappend\nshell option is enabled (see the description of\nshopt\nunder\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow),\nbash\nappends the entries to\nthe history file, otherwise it overwrites the history file.  If\nHISTFILE\nis unset or null, or if the history file is unwritable,\nthe history is not saved.  After saving the history,\nbash\ntruncates the history file to contain no more than\nHISTFILESIZE\nlines as described above.\nIf the\nHISTTIMEFORMAT\nvariable is set, the shell writes the\ntimestamp information associated with each history entry to the\nhistory file, marked with the history comment character, so\ntimestamps are preserved across shell sessions.  This uses the\nhistory comment character to distinguish timestamps from other\nhistory lines.  As above, when using\nHISTTIMEFORMAT\n, the\ntimestamps delimit multi-line history entries.\nThe\nfc\nbuiltin command (see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow) will\nlist or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list.  The\nhistory\nbuiltin can display or modify the history list and\nmanipulate the history file.  When using command-line editing,\nsearch commands are available in each editing mode that provide\naccess to the history list.\nThe shell allows control over which commands are saved on the\nhistory list.  The\nHISTCONTROL\nand\nHISTIGNORE\nvariables are used\nto save only a subset of the commands entered.  If the\ncmdhist\nshell option is enabled, the shell attempts to save each line of a\nmulti-line command in the same history entry, adding semicolons\nwhere necessary to preserve syntactic correctness.  The\nlithist\nshell option modifies\ncmdhist\nby saving the command with embedded\nnewlines instead of semicolons.  See the description of the\nshopt\nbuiltin below under\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nfor information on\nsetting and unsetting shell options.\nHISTORY EXPANSION\ntop\nThe shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to\nthe history expansion in\ncsh\n.  This section describes what syntax\nfeatures are available.\nHistory expansion is enabled by default for interactive shells,\nand can be disabled using the\n+H\noption to the\nset\nbuiltin command\n(see\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\nbelow).  Non-interactive shells do not\nperform history expansion by default, but it can be enabled with\nâset -Hâ.\nHistory expansions introduce words from the history list into the\ninput stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the\narguments to a previous command into the current input line, or\nfix errors in previous commands quickly.\nHistory expansion is performed immediately after a complete line\nis read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed\non each line individually.  The shell attempts to inform the\nhistory expansion functions about quoting still in effect from\nprevious lines.\nIt takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which\nhistory list entry to use during substitution.  The second is to\nselect portions of that entry to include into the current one.\nThe entry selected from the history is the\nevent\n, and the portions\nof that entry that are acted upon are\nwords\n.  Various\nmodifiers\nare available to manipulate the selected words.  The entry is\nsplit into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so\nthat several\nmetacharacter\n-separated words surrounded by quotes\nare considered one word.  The\nevent designator\nselects the event,\nthe optional\nword designator\nselects words from the event, and\nvarious optional\nmodifiers\nare available to manipulate the\nselected words.\nHistory expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history\nexpansion character, which is\n!\nby default.  History expansions\nmay appear anywhere in the input, but do not nest.\nOnly backslash (\n\\\n) and single quotes can quote the history\nexpansion character, but the history expansion character is also\ntreated as quoted if it immediately precedes the closing double\nquote in a double-quoted string.\nSeveral characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately\nfollowing the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted:\nspace, tab, newline, carriage return,\n=\n, and the other shell\nmetacharacters defined above.\nThere is a special abbreviation for substitution, active when the\nquick substitution\ncharacter (described above under\nhistchars\n) is\nthe first character on the line.  It selects the previous history\nlist entry, using an event designator equivalent to\n!!\n, and\nsubstitutes one string for another in that entry.  It is described\nbelow under\nEvent Designators\n.  This is the only history expansion\nthat does not begin with the history expansion character.\nSeveral shell options settable with the\nshopt\nbuiltin will modify\nhistory expansion behavior (see the description of the\nshopt\nbuiltin below).and If the\nhistverify\nshell option is enabled, and\nreadline\nis being used, history substitutions are not immediately\npassed to the shell parser.  Instead, the expanded line is\nreloaded into the\nreadline\nediting buffer for further\nmodification.  If\nreadline\nis being used, and the\nhistreedit\nshell\noption is enabled, a failed history substitution is reloaded into\nthe\nreadline\nediting buffer for correction.\nThe\n-p\noption to the\nhistory\nbuiltin command shows what a history\nexpansion will do before using it.  The\n-s\noption to the\nhistory\nbuiltin will add commands to the end of the history list without\nactually executing them, so that they are available for subsequent\nrecall.\nThe shell allows control of the various characters used by the\nhistory expansion mechanism (see the description of\nhistchars\nabove under\nShell Variables\n).  The shell uses the history comment\ncharacter to mark history timestamps when writing the history\nfile.\nEvent Designators\nAn event designator is a reference to an entry in the history\nlist.  The event designator consists of the portion of the word\nbeginning with the history expansion character and ending with the\nword designator if present, or the end of the word.  Unless the\nreference is absolute, events are relative to the current position\nin the history list.\n!\nStart a history substitution, except when followed by a\nblank\n, newline, carriage return, =, or, when the\nextglob\nshell option is enabled using the\nshopt\nbuiltin, (.\n!\nn\nRefer to history list entry\nn\n.\n!-\nn\nRefer to the current entry minus\nn\n.\n!!\nRefer to the previous entry.  This is a synonym for â!-1â.\n!\nstring\nRefer to the most recent command preceding the current\nposition in the history list starting with\nstring\n.\n!?\nstring\n[?]\nRefer to the most recent command preceding the current\nposition in the history list containing\nstring\n.  The\ntrailing\n?\nmay be omitted if\nstring\nis followed immediately\nby a newline.  If\nstring\nis missing, this uses the string\nfrom the most recent search; it is an error if there is no\nprevious search string.\n^\nstring1\n^\nstring2\n^\nQuick substitution.

A\n:\nseparates the event\nspecification from the word designator.  It may be omitted if the\nword designator begins with a\n^\n,\n$\n,\n*\n,\n-\n, or\n%\n.  Words are\nnumbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being\ndenoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line\nseparated by single spaces.\n0 (zero)\nThe zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.\nn\nThe\nn\nth word.\n^\nThe first argument: word 1.\n$\nThe last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will\nexpand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the\nline.\n%\nThe first word matched by the most recent â?\nstring\n?â\nsearch, if the search string begins with a character that\nis part of a word.  By default, searches begin at the end\nof each line and proceed to the beginning, so the first\nword matched is the one closest to the end of the line.\nx\n-\ny\nA range of words; â-\ny\nâ abbreviates â0-\ny\nâ.\n*\nAll of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for\nâ\n1-$\nâ.

If\nx\nis\nmissing, it defaults to 0.\nIf a word designator is supplied without an event specification,\nthe previous command is used as the event, equivalent to\n!!\n.\nModifiers\nAfter the optional word designator, the expansion may include a\nsequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded\nby a â:â.  These modify, or edit, the word or words selected from\nthe history event.\nh\nRemove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the\nhead.\nt\nRemove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.\nr\nRemove a trailing suffix of the form\n.xxx\n, leaving the\nbasename.\ne\nRemove all but the trailing suffix.\np\nPrint the new command but do not execute it.\nq\nQuote the substituted words, escaping further\nsubstitutions.\nx\nQuote the substituted words as with\nq\n, but break into words\nat\nblanks\nand newlines.  The\nq\nand\nx\nmodifiers are mutually\nexclusive; expansion uses the last one supplied.\ns/\nold\n/\nnew\n/\nSubstitute\nnew\nfor the first occurrence of\nold\nin the event\nline.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place\nof /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the last\ncharacter of the event line.  A single backslash quotes the\ndelimiter in\nold\nand\nnew\n.  If & appears in\nnew\n, it is\nreplaced with\nold\n.  A single backslash quotes the &.  If\nold\nis null, it is set to the last\nold\nsubstituted, or, if\nno previous history substitutions took place, the last\nstring\nin a\n!?\nstring\n[?]\nsearch.  If\nnew\nis null, each\nmatching\nold\nis deleted.\n&\nRepeat the previous substitution.\ng\nCause changes to be applied over the entire event line.\nThis is used in conjunction with â\n:s\nâ (e.g.,\nâ\n:gs/\nold\n/\nnew\n/\nâ) or â\n:&\nâ.  If used with â\n:s\nâ, any delimiter\ncan be used in place of /, and the final delimiter is\noptional if it is the last character of the event line.  An\na\nmay be used as a synonym for\ng\n.\nG\nApply the following â\ns\nâ or â\n&\nâ modifier once to each word\nin the event line.\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\ntop\nUnless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this\nsection as accepting options preceded by\n-\naccepts\n--\nto signify\nthe end of the options.

If the first\ncharacter of\noptstring\nis a colon,\ngetopts\nuses\nsilent\nerror reporting.  In normal operation,\ngetopts\nprints\ndiagnostic messages when it encounters invalid options or\nmissing option arguments.

If\ngetopts\nis silent, it assigns the option\ncharacter found to\nOPTARG\nand does not print a diagnostic\nmessage.\nIf a required argument is not found, and\ngetopts\nis not\nsilent, it sets the value of\nname\nto a question mark (\n?\n),\nunsets\nOPTARG\n, and prints a diagnostic message.  If\ngetopts\nis silent, it sets the value of\nname\nto a colon (\n:\n) and\nsets\nOPTARG\nto the option character found.\ngetopts\nreturns true if an option, specified or\nunspecified, is found.

If the format string uses the\nprintf\nalternate form, these two formats quote the\nargument string using single quotes.\n%Q\nlike\n%q\n, but applies any supplied precision to the\nargument\nbefore quoting it.\n%(\ndatefmt\n)T\ncauses\nprintf\nto output the date-time string\nresulting from using\ndatefmt\nas a format string for\nstrftime(3)\n.  The corresponding\nargument\nis an\ninteger representing the number of seconds since the\nepoch.  This format specifier recognizes two special\nargument values: -1 represents the current time, and\n-2 represents the time the shell was invoked.  If no\nargument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1\nhad been supplied.  This is an exception to the\nusual\nprintf\nbehavior.\nThe %b, %q, and %T format specifiers all use the field\nwidth and precision arguments from the format specification\nand write that many bytes from (or use that wide a field\nfor) the expanded argument, which usually contains more\ncharacters than the original.\nThe %n format specifier accepts a corresponding argument\nthat is treated as a shell variable name.\nThe %s and %c format specifiers accept an l (long)\nmodifier, which forces them to convert the argument string\nto a wide-character string and apply any supplied field\nwidth and precision in terms of characters, not bytes.  The\n%S and %C format specifiers are equivalent to %ls and %lc,\nrespectively.\nArguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C\nconstants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is\nallowed, and if the leading character is a single or double\nquote, the value is the numeric value of the following\ncharacter, using the current locale.\nThe\nformat\nis reused as necessary to consume all of the\narguments\n.  If the\nformat\nrequires more\narguments\nthan are\nsupplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a\nzero value or null string, as appropriate, had been\nsupplied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero if\nan invalid option is supplied or a write or assignment\nerror occurs.\npushd\n[\n-n\n] [+\nn\n] [-\nn\n]\npushd\n[\n-n\n] [\ndir\n]\nAdd a directory to the top of the directory stack, or\nrotate the stack, making the new top of the stack the\ncurrent working directory.  With no arguments,\npushd\nexchanges the top two elements of the directory stack.\nArguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:\n-n\nSuppress the normal change of directory when\nrotating or adding directories to the stack, only\nmanipulate the stack.\n+\nn\nRotate the stack so that the\nn\nth directory (counting\nfrom the left of the list shown by\ndirs\n, starting\nwith zero) is at the top.\n-\nn\nRotates the stack so that the\nn\nth directory\n(counting from the right of the list shown by\ndirs\n,\nstarting with zero) is at the top.\ndir\nAdds\ndir\nto the directory stack at the top.\nAfter the stack has been modified, if the\n-n\noption was not\nsupplied,\npushd\nuses the\ncd\nbuiltin to change to the\ndirectory at the top of the stack.  If the\ncd\nfails,\npushd\nreturns a non-zero value.\nOtherwise, if no arguments are supplied,\npushd\nreturns zero\nunless the directory stack is empty.  When rotating the\ndirectory stack,\npushd\nreturns zero unless the directory\nstack is empty or\nn\nspecifies a non-existent directory\nstack element.\nIf the\npushd\ncommand is successful,\nbash\nruns\ndirs\nto show\nthe final contents of the directory stack.\npwd\n[\n-LP\n]\nPrint the absolute pathname of the current working\ndirectory.

If there are\nmore words than names, the remaining words and their\nintervening delimiters are assigned to the last\nname\n.  If\nthere are fewer words read from the input stream than\nnames, the remaining names are assigned empty values.  The\ncharacters in the value of the\nIFS\nvariable are used to\nsplit the line into words using the same rules the shell\nuses for expansion (described above under\nWord Splitting\n).\nThe backslash character (\n\\\n) removes any special meaning for\nthe next character read and is used for line continuation.\nOptions, if supplied, have the following meanings:\n-a\naname\nThe words are assigned to sequential indices of the\narray variable\naname\n, starting at 0.\naname\nis unset\nbefore any new values are assigned.

Any\ndelimiter characters in the input are not treated\nspecially and do not cause\nread\nto return until it\nhas read\nnchars\ncharacters.

This option is\nonly effective if\nread\nis reading input from a\nterminal, pipe, or other special file; it has no\neffect when reading from regular files.  If\nread\ntimes out, it saves any partial input read into the\nspecified variable\nname\n, and the exit status is\ngreater than 128.  If\ntimeout\nis 0,\nread\nreturns\nimmediately, without trying to read any data.  In\nthis case, the exit status is 0 if input is\navailable on the specified file descriptor, or the\nread will return EOF, non-zero otherwise.\n-u\nfd\nRead input from file descriptor\nfd\ninstead of the\nstandard input.\nOther than the case where\ndelim\nis the empty string,\nread\nignores any NUL characters in the input.\nIf no\nnames\nare supplied,\nread\nassigns the line read,\nwithout the ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified, to\nthe variable\nREPLY\n.\nThe exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered,\nread\ntimes out (in which case the status is greater than\n128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a\nreadonly variable) occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is\nsupplied as the argument to\n-u\n.\nreadonly\n[\n-aAf\n] [\n-p\n] [\nname\n[=\nword\n] ...]\nThe given\nnames\nare marked readonly; the values of these\nnames\nmay not be changed by subsequent assignment or unset.\nIf the\n-f\noption is supplied, each\nname\nrefers to a shell\nfunction.

BASH_ARGC\nand\nBASH_ARGV\nare updated as\ndescribed in their descriptions above).\n5.\nFunction tracing is enabled: command\nsubstitution, shell functions, and subshells\ninvoked with\n(\ncommand\n)\ninherit the\nDEBUG\nand\nRETURN\ntraps.\n6.\nError tracing is enabled: command\nsubstitution, shell functions, and subshells\ninvoked with\n(\ncommand\n)\ninherit the\nERR\ntrap.\nextglob\nIf set, enable the extended pattern matching\nfeatures described above under\nPathname Expansion\n.\nextquote\nIf set,\n$\n'\nstring\n' and\n$\n\"\nstring\n\" quoting is\nperformed within\n${\nparameter\n}\nexpansions enclosed\nin double quotes.  This option is enabled by\ndefault.\nfailglob\nIf set, patterns which fail to match filenames\nduring pathname expansion result in an expansion\nerror.\nforce_fignore\nIf set, the suffixes specified by the\nFIGNORE\nshell\nvariable cause words to be ignored when performing\nword completion even if the ignored words are the\nonly possible completions.  See\nShell Variables\nabove for a description of\nFIGNORE\n.  This option is\nenabled by default.\nglobasciiranges\nIf set, range expressions used in pattern matching\nbracket expressions (see\nPattern Matching\nabove)\nbehave as if in the traditional C locale when\nperforming comparisons.  That is, pattern matching\ndoes not take the current locale's collating\nsequence into account, so\nb\nwill not collate\nbetween\nA\nand\nB\n, and upper-case and lower-case\nASCII characters will collate together.\nglobskipdots\nIf set, pathname expansion will never match the\nfilenames\n.\nand\n..\n, even if the pattern begins with\na â.â.  This option is enabled by default.\nglobstar\nIf set, the pattern\n**\nused in a pathname expansion\ncontext will match all files and zero or more\ndirectories and subdirectories.  If the pattern is\nfollowed by a\n/\n, only directories and\nsubdirectories match.\ngnu_errfmt\nIf set, shell error messages are written in the\nstandard GNU error message format.\nhistappend\nIf set, the history list is appended to the file\nnamed by the value of the\nHISTFILE\nvariable when\nthe shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.\nhistreedit\nIf set, and\nreadline\nis being used, the user is\ngiven the opportunity to re-edit a failed history\nsubstitution.\nhistverify\nIf set, and\nreadline\nis being used, the results of\nhistory substitution are not immediately passed to\nthe shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is\nloaded into the\nreadline\nediting buffer, allowing\nfurther modification.\nhostcomplete\nIf set, and\nreadline\nis being used,\nbash\nwill\nattempt to perform hostname completion when a word\ncontaining a\n@\nis being completed (see\nCompleting\nunder\nREADLINE\nabove).  This is enabled by default.\nhuponexit\nIf set,\nbash\nwill send\nSIGHUP\nto all jobs when an\ninteractive login shell exits.\ninherit_errexit\nIf set, command substitution inherits the value of\nthe\nerrexit\noption, instead of unsetting it in the\nsubshell environment.  This option is enabled when\nposix mode is enabled.\ninteractive_comments\nIn an interactive shell, a word beginning with\n#\ncauses that word and all remaining characters on\nthat line to be ignored, as in a non-interactive\nshell (see\nCOMMENTS\nabove).  This option is enabled\nby default.\nlastpipe\nIf set, and job control is not active, the shell\nruns the last command of a pipeline not executed in\nthe background in the current shell environment.\nlithist\nIf set, and the\ncmdhist\noption is enabled, multi-\nline commands are saved to the history with\nembedded newlines rather than using semicolon\nseparators where possible.\nlocalvar_inherit\nIf set, local variables inherit the value and\nattributes of a variable of the same name that\nexists at a previous scope before any new value is\nassigned.  The nameref attribute is not inherited.\nlocalvar_unset\nIf set, calling\nunset\non local variables in\nprevious function scopes marks them so subsequent\nlookups find them unset until that function\nreturns.  This is identical to the behavior of\nunsetting local variables at the current function\nscope.\nlogin_shell\nThe shell sets this option if it is started as a\nlogin shell (see\nINVOCATION\nabove).  The value may\nnot be changed.\nmailwarn\nIf set, and a file that\nbash\nis checking for mail\nhas been accessed since the last time it was\nchecked,\nbash\ndisplays the message âThe mail in\nmailfile\nhas been readâ.\nno_empty_cmd_completion\nIf set, and\nreadline\nis being used,\nbash\ndoes not\nsearch\nPATH\nfor possible completions when\ncompletion is attempted on an empty line.\nnocaseglob\nIf set,\nbash\nmatches filenames in a\ncase-insensitive fashion when performing pathname\nexpansion (see\nPathname Expansion\nabove).\nnocasematch\nIf set,\nbash\nmatches patterns in a case-insensitive\nfashion when performing matching while executing\ncase\nor\n[[\nconditional commands, when performing\npattern substitution word expansions, or when\nfiltering possible completions as part of\nprogrammable completion.\nnoexpand_translation\nIf set,\nbash\nencloses the translated results of\n$\"\n...\n\"\nquoting in single quotes instead of double\nquotes.  If the string is not translated, this has\nno effect.\nnullglob\nIf set, pathname expansion patterns which match no\nfiles (see\nPathname Expansion\nabove) expand to\nnothing and are removed, rather than expanding to\nthemselves.\npatsub_replacement\nIf set,\nbash\nexpands occurrences of\n&\nin the\nreplacement string of pattern substitution to the\ntext matched by the pattern, as described under\nParameter Expansion\nabove.  This option is enabled\nby default.\nprogcomp\nIf set, enable the programmable completion\nfacilities (see\nProgrammable Completion\nabove).\nThis option is enabled by default.\nprogcomp_alias\nIf set, and programmable completion is enabled,\nbash\ntreats a command name that doesn't have any\ncompletions as a possible alias and attempts alias\nexpansion.  If it has an alias,\nbash\nattempts\nprogrammable completion using the command word\nresulting from the expanded alias.\npromptvars\nIf set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion,\ncommand substitution, arithmetic expansion, and\nquote removal after being expanded as described in\nPROMPTING\nabove.  This option is enabled by\ndefault.\nrestricted_shell\nThe shell sets this option if it is started in\nrestricted mode (see\nRESTRICTED SHELL\nbelow).  The\nvalue may not be changed.  This is not reset when\nthe startup files are executed, allowing the\nstartup files to discover whether or not a shell is\nrestricted.\nshift_verbose\nIf set, the\nshift\nbuiltin prints an error message\nwhen the shift count exceeds the number of\npositional parameters.\nsourcepath\nIf set, the\n.\n(\nsource\n) builtin uses the value of\nPATH\nto find the directory containing the file\nsupplied as an argument when the\n-p\noption is not\nsupplied.  This option is enabled by default.\nvarredir_close\nIf set, the shell automatically closes file\ndescriptors assigned using the\n{varname}\nredirection syntax (see\nREDIRECTION\nabove) instead\nof leaving them open when the command completes.\nxpg_echo\nIf set, the\necho\nbuiltin expands backslash-escape\nsequences by default.  If the\nposix\nshell option is\nalso enabled,\necho\ndoes not interpret any options.\nsuspend\n[\n-f\n]\nSuspend the execution of this shell until it receives a\nSIGCONT\nsignal.  A login shell, or a shell without job\ncontrol enabled, cannot be suspended; the\n-f\noption will\noverride this and force the suspension.  The return status\nis 0 unless the shell is a login shell or job control is\nnot enabled and\n-f\nis not supplied.\ntest\nexpr\n[\nexpr\n]\nReturn a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the\nevaluation of the conditional expression\nexpr\n.  Each\noperator and operand must be a separate argument.\nExpressions are composed of the primaries described above\nunder\nCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS\n.\ntest\ndoes not accept any\noptions, nor does it accept and ignore an argument of\n--\nas\nsignifying the end of options.\nExpressions may be combined using the following operators,\nlisted in decreasing order of precedence.  The evaluation\ndepends on the number of arguments; see below.\ntest\nuses\noperator precedence when there are five or more arguments.\n!\nexpr\nTrue if\nexpr\nis false.\n(\nexpr\n)\nReturns the value of\nexpr\n.  This may be used to\noverride normal operator precedence.\nexpr1\n-\na\nexpr2\nTrue if both\nexpr1\nand\nexpr2\nare true.\nexpr1\n-\no\nexpr2\nTrue if either\nexpr1\nor\nexpr2\nis true.\ntest\nand\n[\nevaluate conditional expressions using a set of\nrules based on the number of arguments.\n0 arguments\nThe expression is false.\n1 argument\nThe expression is true if and only if the argument\nis not null.\n2 arguments\nIf the first argument is\n!\n, the expression is true\nif and only if the second argument is null.  If the\nfirst argument is one of the unary conditional\noperators listed above under\nCONDITIONAL\nEXPRESSIONS\n, the expression is true if the unary\ntest is true.  If the first argument is not a valid\nunary conditional operator, the expression is false.\n3 arguments\nThe following conditions are applied in the order\nlisted.  If the second argument is one of the binary\nconditional operators listed above under\nCONDITIONAL\nEXPRESSIONS\n, the result of the expression is the\nresult of the binary test using the first and third\narguments as operands.  The\n-a\nand\n-o\noperators are\nconsidered binary operators when there are three\narguments.  If the first argument is\n!\n, the value is\nthe negation of the two-argument test using the\nsecond and third arguments.  If the first argument\nis exactly\n(\nand the third argument is exactly\n)\n,\nthe result is the one-argument test of the second\nargument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.\n4 arguments\nThe following conditions are applied in the order\nlisted.  If the first argument is\n!\n, the result is\nthe negation of the three-argument expression\ncomposed of the remaining arguments.  If the first\nargument is exactly\n(\nand the fourth argument is\nexactly\n)\n, the result is the two-argument test of\nthe second and third arguments.  Otherwise, the\nexpression is parsed and evaluated according to\nprecedence using the rules listed above.\n5 or more arguments\nThe expression is parsed and evaluated according to\nprecedence using the rules listed above.\nWhen the shell is in posix mode, or if the expression is\npart of the\n[[\ncommand, the\n<\nand\n>\noperators sort using\nthe current locale.  If the shell is not in posix mode, the\ntest\nand\n[\ncommands sort lexicographically using ASCII\nordering.\nThe historical operator-precedence parsing with 4 or more\narguments can lead to ambiguities when it encounters\nstrings that look like primaries.  The POSIX standard has\ndeprecated the\n-a\nand\n-o\nprimaries and enclosing\nexpressions within parentheses.  Scripts should no longer\nuse them.  It's much more reliable to restrict test\ninvocations to a single primary, and to replace uses of\n-a\nand\n-o\nwith the shell's\n&&\nand\n||\nlist operators.\ntimes\nPrint the accumulated user and system times for the shell\nand for processes run from the shell.  The return status is\n0.\ntrap\n[\n-lpP\n] [[\naction\n]\nsigspec\n...]\nThe\naction\nis a command that is read and executed when the\nshell receives any of the signals\nsigspec\n.  If\naction\nis\nabsent (and there is a single\nsigspec\n) or\n-\n, each specified\nsigspec\nis reset to the value it had when the shell was\nstarted.  If\naction\nis the null string the signal specified\nby each\nsigspec\nis ignored by the shell and by the commands\nit invokes.\nIf no arguments are supplied,\ntrap\ndisplays the actions\nassociated with each trapped signal as a set of\ntrap\ncommands that can be reused as shell input to restore the\ncurrent signal dispositions.  If\n-p\nis given, and\naction\nis\nnot present, then\ntrap\ndisplays the actions associated with\neach\nsigspec\nor, if none are supplied, for all trapped\nsignals, as a set of\ntrap\ncommands that can be reused as\nshell input to restore the current signal dispositions.\nThe\n-P\noption behaves similarly, but displays only the\nactions associated with each\nsigspec\nargument.\n-P\nrequires\nat least one\nsigspec\nargument.  The\n-P\nor\n-p\noptions may be\nused in a subshell environment (e.g., command substitution)\nand, as long as they are used before\ntrap\nis used to change\na signal's handling, will display the state of its parent's\ntraps.\nThe\n-l\noption prints a list of signal names and their\ncorresponding numbers.  Each\nsigspec\nis either a signal\nname defined in <\nsignal.h\n>, or a signal number.  Signal\nnames are case insensitive and the\nSIG\nprefix is optional.\nIf\n-l\nis supplied with no\nsigspec\narguments, it prints a\nlist of valid signal names.\nIf a\nsigspec\nis\nEXIT\n(0),\naction\nis executed on exit from\nthe shell.  If a\nsigspec\nis\nDEBUG\n,\naction\nis executed\nbefore every\nsimple command\n,\nfor\ncommand,\ncase\ncommand,\nselect\ncommand, (( arithmetic command, [[ conditional\ncommand, arithmetic\nfor\ncommand, and before the first\ncommand executes in a shell function (see\nSHELL GRAMMAR\nabove).  Refer to the description of the\nextdebug\nshell\noption (see\nshopt\nabove) for details of its effect on the\nDEBUG\ntrap.  If a\nsigspec\nis\nRETURN\n,\naction\nis executed\neach time a shell function or a script executed with the\n.\nor\nsource\nbuiltins finishes executing.\nIf a\nsigspec\nis\nERR\n,\naction\nis executed whenever a pipeline\n(which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or\na compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject\nto the following conditions.  The\nERR\ntrap is not executed\nif the failed command is part of the command list\nimmediately following a\nwhile\nor\nuntil\nreserved word, part\nof the test in an\nif\nstatement, part of a command executed\nin a\n&&\nor\n||\nlist except the command following the final\n&&\nor\n||\n, any command in a pipeline but the last (subject\nto the state of the\npipefail\nshell option), or if the\ncommand's return value is being inverted using\n!\n.  These\nare the same conditions obeyed by the\nerrexit\n(\n-e\n) option.\nWhen the shell is not interactive, signals ignored upon\nentry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.  Interactive\nshells permit trapping signals ignored on entry.  Trapped\nsignals that are not being ignored are reset to their\noriginal values in a subshell or subshell environment when\none is created.  The return status is false if any\nsigspec\nis invalid; otherwise\ntrap\nreturns true.\ntrue\nDoes nothing, returns a 0 status.\ntype\n[\n-aftpP\n]\nname\n[\nname\n...]\nIndicate how each\nname\nwould be interpreted if used as a\ncommand name.\nIf the\n-t\noption is used,\ntype\nprints a string which is one\nof\nalias\n,\nkeyword\n,\nfunction\n,\nbuiltin\n, or\nfile\nif\nname\nis an\nalias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or\nexecutable file, respectively.  If the\nname\nis not found,\ntype\nprints nothing and returns a non-zero exit status.\nIf the\n-p\noption is used,\ntype\neither returns the pathname\nof the executable file that would be found by searching\n$PATH\nfor\nname\nor nothing if âtype -t nameâ would not\nreturn\nfile\n.  The\n-P\noption forces a\nPATH\nsearch for each\nname\n, even if âtype -t nameâ would not return\nfile\n.  If\nname\nis present in the table of hashed commands,\n-p\nand\n-P\nprint the hashed value, which is not necessarily the file\nthat appears first in\nPATH\n.\nIf the\n-a\noption is used,\ntype\nprints all of the places\nthat contain a command named\nname\n.  This includes aliases,\nreserved words, functions, and builtins, but the path\nsearch options (\n-p\nand\n-P\n) can be supplied to restrict the\noutput to executable files.\ntype\ndoes not consult the\ntable of hashed commands when using\n-a\nwith\n-p\n, and only\nperforms a\nPATH\nsearch for\nname\n.\nThe\n-f\noption suppresses shell function lookup, as with the\ncommand\nbuiltin.\ntype\nreturns true if all of the arguments\nare found, false if any are not found.\nulimit\n[\n-HS\n]\n-a\nulimit\n[\n-HS\n] [\n-bcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT\n[\nlimit\n]]\nProvides control over the resources available to the shell\nand to processes it starts, on systems that allow such\ncontrol.\nThe\n-H\nand\n-S\noptions specify whether the hard or soft\nlimit is set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot\nbe increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft\nlimit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.\nIf neither\n-H\nnor\n-S\nis specified,\nulimit\nsets both the\nsoft and hard limits.\nThe value of\nlimit\ncan be a number in the unit specified\nfor the resource or one of the special values\nhard\n,\nsoft\n,\nor\nunlimited\n, which stand for the current hard limit, the\ncurrent soft limit, and no limit, respectively.  If\nlimit\nis omitted,\nulimit\nprints the current value of the soft\nlimit of the resource, unless the\n-H\noption is given.  When\nmore than one resource is specified, the limit name and\nunit, if appropriate, are printed before the value.  Other\noptions are interpreted as follows:\n-a\nReport all current limits; no limits are set.\n-b\nThe maximum socket buffer size.\n-c\nThe maximum size of core files created.\n-d\nThe maximum size of a process's data segment.\n-e\nThe maximum scheduling priority (âniceâ).\n-f\nThe maximum size of files written by the shell and\nits children.\n-i\nThe maximum number of pending signals.\n-k\nThe maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated.\n-l\nThe maximum size that may be locked into memory.\n-m\nThe maximum resident set size (many systems do not\nhonor this limit).\n-n\nThe maximum number of open file descriptors (most\nsystems do not allow this value to be set).\n-p\nThe pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be\nset).\n-q\nThe maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues.\n-r\nThe maximum real-time scheduling priority.\n-s\nThe maximum stack size.\n-t\nThe maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.\n-u\nThe maximum number of processes available to a\nsingle user.\n-v\nThe maximum amount of virtual memory available to\nthe shell and, on some systems, to its children.\n-x\nThe maximum number of file locks.\n-P\nThe maximum number of pseudoterminals.\n-R\nThe maximum time a real-time process can run before\nblocking, in microseconds.\n-T\nThe maximum number of threads.\nIf\nlimit\nis supplied, and the\n-a\noption is not used,\nlimit\nis the new value of the specified resource.  If no option\nis supplied, then\n-f\nis assumed.\nValues are in 1024-byte increments, except for\n-t\n, which is\nin seconds;\n-R\n, which is in microseconds;\n-p\n, which is in\nunits of 512-byte blocks;\n-P\n,\n-T\n,\n-b\n,\n-k\n,\n-n\n, and\n-u\n, which\nare unscaled values; and, when in posix mode,\n-c\nand\n-f\n,\nwhich are in 512-byte increments.  The return status is 0\nunless an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an\nerror occurs while setting a new limit.\numask\n[\n-p\n] [\n-S\n] [\nmode\n]\nSet the user file-creation mask to\nmode\n.  If\nmode\nbegins\nwith a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number;\notherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar\nto that accepted by\nchmod(1)\n.  If\nmode\nis omitted,\numask\nprints the current value of the mask.  The\n-S\noption\nwithout a\nmode\nargument prints the mask in a symbolic\nformat; the default output is an octal number.  If the\n-p\noption is supplied, and\nmode\nis omitted, the output is in a\nform that may be reused as input.  The return status is\nzero if the mode was successfully changed or if no\nmode\nargument was supplied, and non-zero otherwise.\nunalias\n[-\na\n] [\nname\n...]\nRemove each\nname\nfrom the list of defined aliases.  If\n-a\nis supplied, remove all alias definitions.  The return\nvalue is true unless a supplied\nname\nis not a defined\nalias.\nunset\n[-\nfv\n] [-\nn\n] [\nname\n...]\nFor each\nname\n, remove the corresponding variable or\nfunction.  If the\n-v\noption is given, each\nname\nrefers to a\nshell variable, and that variable is removed.  If\n-f\nis\nspecified, each\nname\nrefers to a shell function, and the\nfunction definition is removed.  If the\n-n\noption is\nsupplied, and\nname\nis a variable with the\nnameref\nattribute,\nname\nwill be unset rather than the variable it\nreferences.\n-n\nhas no effect if the\n-f\noption is supplied.\nRead-only variables and functions may not be unset.  When\nvariables or functions are removed, they are also removed\nfrom the environment passed to subsequent commands.  If no\noptions are supplied, each\nname\nrefers to a variable; if\nthere is no variable by that name, a function with that\nname, if any, is unset.  Some shell variables may not be\nunset.  If any of\nBASH_ALIASES\n,\nBASH_ARGV0\n,\nBASH_CMDS\n,\nBASH_COMMAND\n,\nBASH_SUBSHELL\n,\nBASHPID\n,\nCOMP_WORDBREAKS\n,\nDIRSTACK\n,\nEPOCHREALTIME\n,\nEPOCHSECONDS\n,\nFUNCNAME\n,\nGROUPS\n,\nHISTCMD\n,\nLINENO\n,\nRANDOM\n,\nSECONDS\n, or\nSRANDOM\nare unset,\nthey lose their special properties, even if they are\nsubsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a\nname\nis readonly or may not be unset.\nwait\n[\n-fn\n] [\n-p\nvarname\n] [\nid\n...]\nWait for each specified child process\nid\nand return the\ntermination status of the last\nid\n.  Each\nid\nmay be a\nprocess ID\npid\nor a job specification\njobspec\n; if a jobspec\nis supplied,\nwait\nwaits for all processes in the job.\nIf no options or\nid\ns are supplied,\nwait\nwaits for all\nrunning background jobs and the last-executed process\nsubstitution, if its process id is the same as\n$!\n, and the\nreturn status is zero.\nIf the\n-n\noption is supplied,\nwait\nwaits for any one of the\ngiven\nid\ns or, if no\nid\ns are supplied, any job or process\nsubstitution, to complete and returns its exit status.  If\nnone of the supplied\nid\ns is a child of the shell, or if no\nid\ns are supplied and the shell has no unwaited-for\nchildren, the exit status is 127.\nIf the\n-p\noption is supplied,\nwait\nassigns the process or\njob identifier of the job for which the exit status is\nreturned to the variable\nvarname\nnamed by the option\nargument.  The variable, which cannot be readonly, will be\nunset initially, before any assignment.  This is useful\nonly when used with the\n-n\noption.\nSupplying the\n-f\noption, when job control is enabled,\nforces\nwait\nto wait for each\nid\nto terminate before\nreturning its status, instead of returning when it changes\nstatus.\nIf none of the\nid\ns specify one of the shell's active child\nprocesses, the return status is 127.  If\nwait\nis\ninterrupted by a signal, any\nvarname\nwill remain unset, and\nthe return status will be greater than 128, as described\nunder\nSIGNALS\nabove.  Otherwise, the return status is the\nexit status of the last\nid\n.\nSHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE\ntop\nBash-4.0 introduced the concept of a\nshell compatibility level\n,\nspecified as a set of options to the shopt builtin (\ncompat31\n,\ncompat32\n,\ncompat40\n,\ncompat41\n, and so on).  There is only one\ncurrent compatibility level â each option is mutually exclusive.\nThe compatibility level is intended to allow users to select\nbehavior from previous versions that is incompatible with newer\nversions while they migrate scripts to use current features and\nbehavior.  It's intended to be a temporary solution.\nThis section does not mention behavior that is standard for a\nparticular version (e.g., setting\ncompat32\nmeans that quoting the\nright hand side of the regexp matching operator quotes special\nregexp characters in the word, which is default behavior in\nbash-3.2 and subsequent versions).\nIf a user enables, say,\ncompat32\n, it may affect the behavior of\nother compatibility levels up to and including the current\ncompatibility level.  The idea is that each compatibility level\ncontrols behavior that changed in that version of\nbash\n, but that\nbehavior may have been present in earlier versions.  For instance,\nthe change to use locale-based comparisons with the\n[[\ncommand\ncame in bash-4.1, and earlier versions used ASCII-based\ncomparisons, so enabling\ncompat32\nwill enable ASCII-based\ncomparisons as well.  That granularity may not be sufficient for\nall uses, and as a result users should employ compatibility levels\ncarefully.  Read the documentation for a particular feature to\nfind out the current behavior.\nBash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable:\nBASH_COMPAT\n.  The value\nassigned to this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or\nan integer corresponding to the\ncompat\nNN\noption, like 42)\ndetermines the compatibility level.\nStarting with bash-4.4,\nbash\nbegan deprecating older compatibility\nlevels.  Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of\nBASH_COMPAT\n.\nBash-5.0 was the final version for which there was an individual\nshopt option for the previous version.\nBASH_COMPAT\nis the only\nmechanism to control the compatibility level in versions newer\nthan bash-5.0.\nThe following table describes the behavior changes controlled by\neach compatibility level setting.  The\ncompat\nNN\ntag is used as\nshorthand for setting the compatibility level to\nNN\nusing one of\nthe following mechanisms.  For versions prior to bash-5.0, the\ncompatibility level may be set using the corresponding\ncompat\nNN\nshopt option.  For bash-4.3 and later versions, the\nBASH_COMPAT\nvariable is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and later\nversions.\ncompat31\nâ¢      Quoting the rhs of the\n[[\ncommand's regexp matching\noperator (=~) has no special effect.\ncompat32\nâ¢      The\n<\nand\n>\noperators to the\n[[\ncommand do not\nconsider the current locale when comparing strings;\nthey use ASCII ordering.\ncompat40\nâ¢      The\n<\nand\n>\noperators to the\n[[\ncommand do not\nconsider the current locale when comparing strings;\nthey use ASCII ordering.\nBash\nversions prior to\nbash-4.1 use ASCII collation and\nstrcmp(3)\n; bash-4.1\nand later use the current locale's collation\nsequence and\nstrcoll(3)\n.\ncompat41\nâ¢      In posix mode,\ntime\nmay be followed by options and\nstill be recognized as a reserved word (this is\nPOSIX interpretation 267).\nâ¢      In\nposix\nmode, the parser requires that an even\nnumber of single quotes occur in the\nword\nportion of\na double-quoted parameter expansion and treats them\nspecially, so that characters within the single\nquotes are considered quoted (this is POSIX\ninterpretation 221).\ncompat42\nâ¢      The replacement string in double-quoted pattern\nsubstitution does not undergo quote removal, as it\ndoes in versions after bash-4.2.\nâ¢      In posix mode, single quotes are considered special\nwhen expanding the\nword\nportion of a double-quoted\nparameter expansion and can be used to quote a\nclosing brace or other special character (this is\npart of POSIX interpretation 221); in later\nversions, single quotes are not special within\ndouble-quoted word expansions.\ncompat43\nâ¢      Word expansion errors are considered non-fatal\nerrors that cause the current command to fail, even\nin posix mode (the default behavior is to make them\nfatal errors that cause the shell to exit).\nâ¢      When executing a shell function, the loop state\n(while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so\nbreak\nor\ncontinue\nin that function will break or continue\nloops in the calling context.  Bash-4.4 and later\nreset the loop state to prevent this.\ncompat44\nâ¢      The shell sets up the values used by\nBASH_ARGV\nand\nBASH_ARGC\nso they can expand to the shell's\npositional parameters even if extended debugging\nmode is not enabled.\nâ¢      A subshell inherits loops from its parent context,\nso\nbreak\nor\ncontinue\nwill cause the subshell to\nexit.  Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state to\nprevent the exit\nâ¢      Variable assignments preceding builtins like\nexport\nand\nreadonly\nthat set attributes continue to affect\nvariables with the same name in the calling\nenvironment even if the shell is not in posix mode.\ncompat50\nâ¢      Bash-5.1 changed the way\n$RANDOM\nis generated to\nintroduce slightly more randomness.  If the shell\ncompatibility level is set to 50 or lower, it\nreverts to the method from bash-5.0 and previous\nversions, so seeding the random number generator by\nassigning a value to\nRANDOM\nwill produce the same\nsequence as in bash-5.0.\nâ¢      If the command hash table is empty, bash versions\nprior to bash-5.1 printed an informational message\nto that effect, even when producing output that can\nbe reused as input.  Bash-5.1 suppresses that\nmessage when the\n-l\noption is supplied.\ncompat51\nâ¢      The\nunset\nbuiltin treats attempts to unset array\nsubscripts\n@\nand\n*\ndifferently depending on whether\nthe array is indexed or associative, and differently\nthan in previous versions.\nâ¢      Arithmetic commands (\n((\n...\n))\n) and the expressions\nin an arithmetic for statement can be expanded more\nthan once.\nâ¢      Expressions used as arguments to arithmetic\noperators in the\n[[\nconditional command can be\nexpanded more than once.\nâ¢      The expressions in substring parameter brace\nexpansion can be expanded more than once.\nâ¢      The expressions in the\n$((\n...\n))\nword expansion can\nbe expanded more than once.\nâ¢      Arithmetic expressions used as indexed array\nsubscripts can be expanded more than once.\nâ¢\ntest -v\n, when given an argument of\nA[@]\n, where\nA\nis\nan existing associative array, will return true if\nthe array has any set elements.  Bash-5.2 will look\nfor and report on a key named\n@\n.\nâ¢      The ${\nparameter\n[:]=\nvalue\n} word expansion will return\nvalue\n, before any variable-specific transformations\nhave been performed (e.g., converting to lowercase).\nBash-5.2 will return the final value assigned to the\nvariable.\nâ¢      Parsing command substitutions will behave as if\nextended globbing (see the description of the\nshopt\nbuiltin above) is enabled, so that parsing a command\nsubstitution containing an extglob pattern (say, as\npart of a shell function) will not fail.  This\nassumes the intent is to enable extglob before the\ncommand is executed and word expansions are\nperformed.  It will fail at word expansion time if\nextglob hasn't been enabled by the time the command\nis executed.\ncompat52\nâ¢      The\ntest\nbuiltin uses its historical algorithm to\nparse parenthesized subexpressions when given five\nor more arguments.\nâ¢      If the\n-p\nor\n-P\noption is supplied to the\nbind\nbuiltin,\nbind\ntreats any arguments remaining after\noption processing as bindable command names, and\ndisplays any key sequences bound to those commands,\ninstead of treating the arguments as key sequences\nto bind.\nRESTRICTED SHELL\ntop\nIf\nbash\nis started with the name\nrbash\n, or the\n-r\noption is\nsupplied at invocation, the shell becomes\nrestricted\n.  A\nrestricted shell is used to set up an environment more controlled\nthan the standard shell.  It behaves identically to\nbash\nwith the\nexception that the following are disallowed or not performed:\nâ¢      Changing directories with\ncd\n.\nâ¢      Setting or unsetting the values of\nSHELL\n,\nPATH\n,\nHISTFILE\n,\nENV\n, or\nBASH_ENV\n.\nâ¢      Specifying command names containing\n/\n.\nâ¢      Specifying a filename containing a\n/\nas an argument to the\n.\nbuiltin command.\nâ¢      Using the\n-p\noption to the\n.\nbuiltin command to specify a\nsearch path.\nâ¢      Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to\nthe\nhistory\nbuiltin command.\nâ¢      Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to\nthe\n-p\noption to the\nhash\nbuiltin command.\nâ¢      Importing function definitions from the shell environment\nat startup.\nâ¢      Parsing the values of\nBASHOPTS\nand\nSHELLOPTS\nfrom the shell\nenvironment at startup.\nâ¢      Redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >>\nredirection operators.\nâ¢      Using the\nexec\nbuiltin command to replace the shell with\nanother command.\nâ¢      Adding or deleting builtin commands with the\n-f\nand\n-d\noptions to the\nenable\nbuiltin command.\nâ¢      Using the\nenable\nbuiltin command to enable disabled shell\nbuiltins.\nâ¢      Specifying the\n-p\noption to the\ncommand\nbuiltin command.\nâ¢      Turning off restricted mode with\nset +r\nor\nshopt -u\nrestricted_shell\n.\nThese restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.\nWhen a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\nabove),\nrbash\nturns off any restrictions in the\nshell spawned to execute the script.\nSEE ALSO\ntop\nBash Reference Manual\n, Brian Fox and Chet Ramey\nThe Gnu Readline Library\n, Brian Fox and Chet Ramey\nThe Gnu History Library\n, Brian Fox and Chet Ramey\nPortable Operating System Interface (POSIX) Part 2: Shell and\nUtilities\n, IEEE â\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/\nhttp://tiswww.case.edu/~chet/bash/POSIX\nâ a description of posix\nmode\nsh\n(1),\nksh\n(1),\ncsh\n(1)\nemacs\n(1),\nvi\n(1)\nreadline(3)\nFILES\ntop\n/bin/bash\nThe\nbash\nexecutable\n/etc/profile\nThe systemwide initialization file, executed for login\nshells\n~/.bash_profile\nThe personal initialization file, executed for login shells\n~/.bashrc\nThe individual per-interactive-shell startup file\n~/.bash_logout\nThe individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a\nlogin shell exits\n~/.bash_history\nThe default value of\nHISTFILE\n, the file in which bash saves\nthe command history\n~/.inputrc\nIndividual\nreadline\ninitialization file\nAUTHORS\ntop\nBrian Fox, Free Software Foundation\nbfox@gnu.org\nChet Ramey, Case Western Reserve University\nchet.ramey@case.edu\nBUG REPORTS\ntop\nIf you find a bug in\nbash\n, you should report it.

An\nawk\nprogram is a sequence of patterns and\ncorresponding actions. When input is read that matches a pattern,\nthe action associated with that pattern is carried out.\nInput shall be interpreted as a sequence of records. By default, a\nrecord is a line, less its terminating <newline>, but this can be\nchanged by using the\nRS\nbuilt-in variable. Each record of input\nshall be matched in turn against each pattern in the program. For\neach pattern matched, the associated action shall be executed.\nThe\nawk\nutility shall interpret each input record as a sequence of\nfields where, by default, a field is a string of non-<blank>\nnon-<newline> characters. This default <blank> and <newline> field\ndelimiter can be changed by using the\nFS\nbuilt-in variable or the\n-F\nsepstring\noption. The\nawk\nutility shall denote the first field\nin a record $1, the second $2, and so on. The symbol $0 shall\nrefer to the entire record; setting any other field causes the re-\nevaluation of $0. Assigning to $0 shall reset the values of all\nother fields and the\nNF\nbuilt-in variable.\nOPTIONS\ntop\nThe\nawk\nutility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of\nPOSIX.1â2017,\nSection 12.2\n,\nUtility Syntax Guidelines\n.\nThe following options shall be supported:\n-F\nsepstring\nDefine the input field separator. This option shall be\nequivalent to:\n-v FS=\nsepstring\nexcept that if\n-F\nsepstring\nand\n-v\nFS=\nsepstring\nare both\nused, it is unspecified whether the\nFS\nassignment\nresulting from\n-F\nsepstring\nis processed in command line\norder or is processed after the last\n-v\nFS=\nsepstring\n.\nSee the description of the\nFS\nbuilt-in variable, and how\nit is used, in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.\n-f\nprogfile\nSpecify the pathname of the file\nprogfile\ncontaining an\nawk\nprogram. A pathname of\n'-'\nshall denote the standard\ninput. If multiple instances of this option are\nspecified, the concatenation of the files specified as\nprogfile\nin the order specified shall be the\nawk\nprogram. The\nawk\nprogram can alternatively be specified\nin the command line as a single argument.\n-v\nassignment\nThe application shall ensure that the\nassignment\nargument is in the same form as an\nassignment\noperand.\nThe specified variable assignment shall occur prior to\nexecuting the\nawk\nprogram, including the actions\nassociated with\nBEGIN\npatterns (if any). Multiple\noccurrences of this option can be specified.\nOPERANDS\ntop\nThe following operands shall be supported:\nprogram\nIf no\n-f\noption is specified, the first operand to\nawk\nshall be the text of the\nawk\nprogram. The application\nshall supply the\nprogram\noperand as a single argument to\nawk\n.  If the text does not end in a <newline>,\nawk\nshall\ninterpret the text as if it did.\nargument\nEither of the following two types of\nargument\ncan be\nintermixed:\nfile\nA pathname of a file that contains the input\nto be read, which is matched against the set\nof patterns in the program. If no\nfile\noperands are specified, or if a\nfile\noperand\nis\n'-'\n, the standard input shall be used.\nassignment\nAn operand that begins with an <underscore> or\nalphabetic character from the portable\ncharacter set (see the table in the Base\nDefinitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nSection\n6.1\n,\nPortable Character Set\n), followed by a\nsequence of underscores, digits, and\nalphabetics from the portable character set,\nfollowed by the\n'='\ncharacter, shall specify a\nvariable assignment rather than a pathname.\nThe characters before the\n'='\nrepresent the\nname of an\nawk\nvariable; if that name is an\nawk\nreserved word (see\nGrammar\n) the behavior\nis undefined. The characters following the\n<equals-sign> shall be interpreted as if they\nappeared in the\nawk\nprogram preceded and\nfollowed by a double-quote (\n'\"'\n) character, as\na\nSTRING\ntoken (see\nGrammar\n), except that if\nthe last character is an unescaped\n<backslash>, it shall be interpreted as a\nliteral <backslash> rather than as the first\ncharacter of the sequence\n\"\\\"\"\n.  The variable\nshall be assigned the value of that\nSTRING\ntoken and, if appropriate, shall be considered\na\nnumeric string\n(see\nExpressions in awk\n), the\nvariable shall also be assigned its numeric\nvalue. Each such variable assignment shall\noccur just prior to the processing of the\nfollowing\nfile\n, if any. Thus, an assignment\nbefore the first\nfile\nargument shall be\nexecuted after the\nBEGIN\nactions (if any),\nwhile an assignment after the last\nfile\nargument shall occur before the\nEND\nactions\n(if any). If there are no\nfile\narguments,\nassignments shall be executed before\nprocessing the standard input.\nSTDIN\ntop\nThe standard input shall be used only if no\nfile\noperands are\nspecified, or if a\nfile\noperand is\n'-'\n, or if a\nprogfile\noption-\nargument is\n'-'\n; see the INPUT FILES section. If the\nawk\nprogram\ncontains no actions and no patterns, but is otherwise a valid\nawk\nprogram, standard input and any\nfile\noperands shall not be read\nand\nawk\nshall exit with a return status of zero.\nINPUT FILES\ntop\nInput files to the\nawk\nprogram from any of the following sources\nshall be text files:\n*  Any\nfile\noperands or their equivalents, achieved by modifying\nthe\nawk\nvariables\nARGV\nand\nARGC\n*  Standard input in the absence of any\nfile\noperands\n*  Arguments to the\ngetline\nfunction\nWhether the variable\nRS\nis set to a value other than a <newline>\nor not, for these files, implementations shall support records\nterminated with the specified separator up to {LINE_MAX} bytes and\nmay support longer records.\nIf\n-f\nprogfile\nis specified, the application shall ensure that the\nfiles named by each of the\nprogfile\noption-arguments are text\nfiles and their concatenation, in the same order as they appear in\nthe arguments, is an\nawk\nprogram.\nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\ntop\nThe following environment variables shall affect the execution of\nawk\n:\nLANG\nProvide a default value for the internationalization\nvariables that are unset or null. (See the Base\nDefinitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nSection 8.2\n,\nInternationalization Variables\nfor the precedence of\ninternationalization variables used to determine the\nvalues of locale categories.)\nLC_ALL\nIf set to a non-empty string value, override the values\nof all the other internationalization variables.\nLC_COLLATE\nDetermine the locale for the behavior of ranges,\nequivalence classes, and multi-character collating\nelements within regular expressions and in comparisons\nof string values.\nLC_CTYPE\nDetermine the locale for the interpretation of sequences\nof bytes of text data as characters (for example,\nsingle-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in\narguments and input files), the behavior of character\nclasses within regular expressions, the identification\nof characters as letters, and the mapping of uppercase\nand lowercase characters for the\ntoupper\nand\ntolower\nfunctions.\nLC_MESSAGES\nDetermine the locale that should be used to affect the\nformat and contents of diagnostic messages written to\nstandard error.\nLC_NUMERIC\nDetermine the radix character used when interpreting\nnumeric input, performing conversions between numeric\nand string values, and formatting numeric output.\nRegardless of locale, the <period> character (the\ndecimal-point character of the POSIX locale) is the\ndecimal-point character recognized in processing\nawk\nprograms (including assignments in command line\narguments).\nNLSPATH\nDetermine the location of message catalogs for the\nprocessing of\nLC_MESSAGES\n.\nPATH\nDetermine the search path when looking for commands\nexecuted by\nsystem\n(\nexpr\n), or input and output pipes; see\nthe Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nChapter 8\n,\nEnvironment Variables\n.\nIn addition, all environment variables shall be visible via the\nawk\nvariable\nENVIRON\n.\nASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS\ntop\nDefault.\nSTDOUT\ntop\nThe nature of the output files depends on the\nawk\nprogram.\nSTDERR\ntop\nThe standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.\nOUTPUT FILES\ntop\nThe nature of the output files depends on the\nawk\nprogram.\nEXTENDED DESCRIPTION\ntop\nOverall Program Structure\nAn\nawk\nprogram is composed of pairs of the form:\npattern\n{\naction\n}\nEither the pattern or the action (including the enclosing brace\ncharacters) can be omitted.\nA missing pattern shall match any record of input, and a missing\naction shall be equivalent to:\n{ print }\nExecution of the\nawk\nprogram shall start by first executing the\nactions associated with all\nBEGIN\npatterns in the order they occur\nin the program. Then each\nfile\noperand (or standard input if no\nfiles were specified) shall be processed in turn by reading data\nfrom the file until a record separator is seen (<newline> by\ndefault). Before the first reference to a field in the record is\nevaluated, the record shall be split into fields, according to the\nrules in\nRegular Expressions\n, using the value of\nFS\nthat was\ncurrent at the time the record was read. Each pattern in the\nprogram then shall be evaluated in the order of occurrence, and\nthe action associated with each pattern that matches the current\nrecord executed. The action for a matching pattern shall be\nexecuted before evaluating subsequent patterns. Finally, the\nactions associated with all\nEND\npatterns shall be executed in the\norder they occur in the program.\nExpressions in awk\nExpressions describe computations used in\npatterns\nand\nactions\n.\nIn the following table, valid expression operations are given in\ngroups from highest precedence first to lowest precedence last,\nwith equal-precedence operators grouped between horizontal lines.\nIn expression evaluation, where the grammar is formally ambiguous,\nhigher precedence operators shall be evaluated before lower\nprecedence operators. In this table\nexpr\n,\nexpr1\n,\nexpr2\n, and\nexpr3\nrepresent any expression, while lvalue represents any entity that\ncan be assigned to (that is, on the left side of an assignment\noperator).  The precise syntax of expressions is given in\nGrammar\n.\nTable 4-1: Expressions in Decreasing Precedence

expression shall have either a string value, a numeric value,\nor both. Except as stated for specific contexts, the value of an\nexpression shall be implicitly converted to the type needed for\nthe context in which it is used. A string value shall be converted\nto a numeric value either by the equivalent of the following calls\nto functions defined by the ISO C standard:\nsetlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"\");\nnumeric_value\n= atof(\nstring_value\n);\nor by converting the initial portion of the string to type\ndouble\nrepresentation as follows:\nThe input string is decomposed into two parts: an initial,\npossibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as\nspecified by\nisspace\n()) and a subject sequence interpreted\nas a floating-point constant.\nThe expected form of the subject sequence is an optional\n'+'\nor\n'-'\nsign, then a non-empty sequence of digits\noptionally containing a <period>, then an optional exponent\npart. An exponent part consists of\n'e'\nor\n'E'\n, followed by\nan optional sign, followed by one or more decimal digits.\nThe sequence starting with the first digit or the <period>\n(whichever occurs first) is interpreted as a floating\nconstant of the C language, and if neither an exponent part\nnor a <period> appears, a <period> is assumed to follow the\nlast digit in the string. If the subject sequence begins\nwith a <hyphen-minus>, the value resulting from the\nconversion is negated.\nA numeric value that is exactly equal to the value of an integer\n(see\nSection 1.1.2\n,\nConcepts Derived from the ISO C Standard\n)\nshall be converted to a string by the equivalent of a call to the\nsprintf\nfunction (see\nString Functions\n) with the string\n\"%d\"\nas\nthe\nfmt\nargument and the numeric value being converted as the\nfirst and only\nexpr\nargument. Any other numeric value shall be\nconverted to a string by the equivalent of a call to the\nsprintf\nfunction with the value of the variable\nCONVFMT\nas the\nfmt\nargument and the numeric value being converted as the first and\nonly\nexpr\nargument. The result of the conversion is unspecified if\nthe value of\nCONVFMT\nis not a floating-point format specification.\nThis volume of POSIX.1â2017 specifies no explicit conversions\nbetween numbers and strings. An application can force an\nexpression to be treated as a number by adding zero to it, or can\nforce it to be treated as a string by concatenating the null\nstring (\n\"\"\n) to it.\nA string value shall be considered a\nnumeric string\nif it comes\nfrom one of the following:\n1. Field variables\n2. Input from the\ngetline\n() function\n3.\nFILENAME\n4.\nARGV\narray elements\n5.\nENVIRON\narray elements\n6. Array elements created by the\nsplit\n() function\n7. A command line variable assignment\n8. Variable assignment from another numeric string variable\nand an implementation-dependent condition corresponding to either\ncase (a) or (b) below is met.\na. After the equivalent of the following calls to functions\ndefined by the ISO C standard,\nstring_value_end\nwould differ\nfrom\nstring_value\n, and any characters before the terminating\nnull character in\nstring_value_end\nwould be <blank>\ncharacters:\nchar *string_value_end;\nsetlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"\");\nnumeric_value = strtod (string_value, &string_value_end);\nb. After all the following conversions have been applied, the\nresulting string would lexically be recognized as a\nNUMBER\ntoken as described by the lexical conventions in\nGrammar\n:\n--  All leading and trailing <blank> characters are discarded.\n--  If the first non-<blank> is\n'+'\nor\n'-'\n, it is discarded.\n--  Each occurrence of the decimal point character from the\ncurrent locale is changed to a <period>.\nIn case (a) the numeric value of the\nnumeric string\nshall be the\nvalue that would be returned by the\nstrtod\n() call. In case (b) if\nthe first non-<blank> is\n'-'\n, the numeric value of the\nnumeric\nstring\nshall be the negation of the numeric value of the\nrecognized\nNUMBER\ntoken; otherwise, the numeric value of the\nnumeric string\nshall be the numeric value of the recognized\nNUMBER\ntoken. Whether or not a string is a\nnumeric string\nshall be\nrelevant only in contexts where that term is used in this section.\nWhen an expression is used in a Boolean context, if it has a\nnumeric value, a value of zero shall be treated as false and any\nother value shall be treated as true. Otherwise, a string value of\nthe null string shall be treated as false and any other value\nshall be treated as true.  A Boolean context shall be one of the\nfollowing:\n*  The first subexpression of a conditional expression\n*  An expression operated on by logical NOT, logical AND, or\nlogical OR\n*  The second expression of a\nfor\nstatement\n*  The expression of an\nif\nstatement\n*  The expression of the\nwhile\nclause in either a\nwhile\nor\ndo\n...\nwhile\nstatement\n*  An expression used as a pattern (as in Overall Program\nStructure)\nAll arithmetic shall follow the semantics of floating-point\narithmetic as specified by the ISO C standard (see\nSection 1.1.2\n,\nConcepts Derived from the ISO C Standard\n).\nThe value of the expression:\nexpr1\n^\nexpr2\nshall be equivalent to the value returned by the ISO C standard\nfunction call:\npow(\nexpr1\n,\nexpr2\n)\nThe expression:\nlvalue ^=\nexpr\nshall be equivalent to the ISO C standard expression:\nlvalue = pow(lvalue,\nexpr\n)\nexcept that lvalue shall be evaluated only once. The value of the\nexpression:\nexpr1\n%\nexpr2\nshall be equivalent to the value returned by the ISO C standard\nfunction call:\nfmod(\nexpr1\n,\nexpr2\n)\nThe expression:\nlvalue %=\nexpr\nshall be equivalent to the ISO C standard expression:\nlvalue = fmod(lvalue,\nexpr\n)\nexcept that lvalue shall be evaluated only once.\nVariables and fields shall be set by the assignment statement:\nlvalue =\nexpression\nand the type of\nexpression\nshall determine the resulting variable\ntype. The assignment includes the arithmetic assignments (\n\"+=\"\n,\n\"-=\"\n,\n\"*=\"\n,\n\"/=\"\n,\n\"%=\"\n,\n\"^=\"\n,\n\"++\"\n,\n\"--\"\n) all of which shall\nproduce a numeric result. The left-hand side of an assignment and\nthe target of increment and decrement operators can be one of a\nvariable, an array with index, or a field selector.\nThe\nawk\nlanguage supplies arrays that are used for storing numbers\nor strings.  Arrays need not be declared. They shall initially be\nempty, and their sizes shall change dynamically. The subscripts,\nor element identifiers, are strings, providing a type of\nassociative array capability. An array name followed by a\nsubscript within square brackets can be used as an lvalue and thus\nas an expression, as described in the grammar; see\nGrammar\n.\nUnsubscripted array names can be used in only the following\ncontexts:\n*  A parameter in a function definition or function call\n*  The\nNAME\ntoken following any use of the keyword\nin\nas\nspecified in the grammar (see\nGrammar\n); if the name used in\nthis context is not an array name, the behavior is undefined\nA valid array\nindex\nshall consist of one or more <comma>-separated\nexpressions, similar to the way in which multi-dimensional arrays\nare indexed in some programming languages. Because\nawk\narrays are\nreally one-dimensional, such a <comma>-separated list shall be\nconverted to a single string by concatenating the string values of\nthe separate expressions, each separated from the other by the\nvalue of the\nSUBSEP\nvariable. Thus, the following two index\noperations shall be equivalent:\nvar\n[\nexpr1\n,\nexpr2\n, ...\nexprn\n]\nvar\n[\nexpr1\nSUBSEP\nexpr2\nSUBSEP ... SUBSEP\nexprn\n]\nThe application shall ensure that a multi-dimensioned\nindex\nused\nwith the\nin\noperator is parenthesized. The\nin\noperator, which\ntests for the existence of a particular array element, shall not\ncause that element to exist. Any other reference to a nonexistent\narray element shall automatically create it.\nComparisons (with the\n'<'\n,\n\"<=\"\n,\n\"!=\"\n,\n\"==\"\n,\n'>'\n, and\n\">=\"\noperators) shall be made numerically if both operands are numeric,\nif one is numeric and the other has a string value that is a\nnumeric string, or if one is numeric and the other has the\nuninitialized value.  Otherwise, operands shall be converted to\nstrings as required and a string comparison shall be made as\nfollows:\n*  For the\n\"!=\"\nand\n\"==\"\noperators, the strings should be\ncompared to check if they are identical but may be compared\nusing the locale-specific collation sequence to check if they\ncollate equally.\n*  For the other operators, the strings shall be compared using\nthe locale-specific collation sequence.\nThe value of the comparison expression shall be 1 if the relation\nis true, or 0 if the relation is false.\nVariables and Special Variables\nVariables can be used in an\nawk\nprogram by referencing them. With\nthe exception of function parameters (see\nUser-Defined Functions\n),\nthey are not explicitly declared. Function parameter names shall\nbe local to the function; all other variable names shall be\nglobal. The same name shall not be used as both a function\nparameter name and as the name of a function or a special\nawk\nvariable. The same name shall not be used both as a variable name\nwith global scope and as the name of a function. The same name\nshall not be used within the same scope both as a scalar variable\nand as an array.  Uninitialized variables, including scalar\nvariables, array elements, and field variables, shall have an\nuninitialized value. An uninitialized value shall have both a\nnumeric value of zero and a string value of the empty string.\nEvaluation of variables with an uninitialized value, to either\nstring or numeric, shall be determined by the context in which\nthey are used.\nField variables shall be designated by a\n'$'\nfollowed by a number\nor numerical expression. The effect of the field number\nexpression\nevaluating to anything other than a non-negative integer is\nunspecified; uninitialized variables or string values need not be\nconverted to numeric values in this context. New field variables\ncan be created by assigning a value to them. References to\nnonexistent fields (that is, fields after $\nNF\n), shall evaluate to\nthe uninitialized value. Such references shall not create new\nfields. However, assigning to a nonexistent field (for example,\n$(\nNF\n+2)=5) shall increase the value of\nNF\n; create any intervening\nfields with the uninitialized value; and cause the value of $0 to\nbe recomputed, with the fields being separated by the value of\nOFS\n.  Each field variable shall have a string value or an\nuninitialized value when created. Field variables shall have the\nuninitialized value when created from $0 using\nFS\nand the variable\ndoes not contain any characters. If appropriate, the field\nvariable shall be considered a numeric string (see\nExpressions in\nawk\n).\nImplementations shall support the following other special\nvariables that are set by\nawk\n:\nARGC\nThe number of elements in the\nARGV\narray.\nARGV\nAn array of command line arguments, excluding options\nand the\nprogram\nargument, numbered from zero to\nARGC\n-1.\nThe arguments in\nARGV\ncan be modified or added to;\nARGC\ncan be altered. As each input file ends,\nawk\nshall treat\nthe next non-null element of\nARGV\n, up to the current\nvalue of\nARGC\n-1, inclusive, as the name of the next\ninput file. Thus, setting an element of\nARGV\nto null\nmeans that it shall not be treated as an input file. The\nname\n'-'\nindicates the standard input. If an argument\nmatches the format of an\nassignment\noperand, this\nargument shall be treated as an\nassignment\nrather than a\nfile\nargument.\nCONVFMT\nThe\nprintf\nformat for converting numbers to strings\n(except for output statements, where\nOFMT\nis used);\n\"%.6g\"\nby default.\nENVIRON\nAn array representing the value of the environment, as\ndescribed in the\nexec\nfunctions defined in the System\nInterfaces volume of POSIX.1â2017. The indices of the\narray shall be strings consisting of the names of the\nenvironment variables, and the value of each array\nelement shall be a string consisting of the value of\nthat variable. If appropriate, the environment variable\nshall be considered a\nnumeric string\n(see\nExpressions in\nawk\n); the array element shall also have its numeric\nvalue.\nIn all cases where the behavior of\nawk\nis affected by\nenvironment variables (including the environment of any\ncommands that\nawk\nexecutes via the\nsystem\nfunction or\nvia pipeline redirections with the\nprint\nstatement, the\nprintf\nstatement, or the\ngetline\nfunction), the\nenvironment used shall be the environment at the time\nawk\nbegan executing; it is implementation-defined\nwhether any modification of\nENVIRON\naffects this\nenvironment.\nFILENAME\nA pathname of the current input file. Inside a\nBEGIN\naction the value is undefined. Inside an\nEND\naction the\nvalue shall be the name of the last input file\nprocessed.\nFNR\nThe ordinal number of the current record in the current\nfile. Inside a\nBEGIN\naction the value shall be zero.\nInside an\nEND\naction the value shall be the number of\nthe last record processed in the last file processed.\nFS\nInput field separator regular expression; a <space> by\ndefault.\nNF\nThe number of fields in the current record. Inside a\nBEGIN\naction, the use of\nNF\nis undefined unless a\ngetline\nfunction without a\nvar\nargument is executed\npreviously. Inside an\nEND\naction,\nNF\nshall retain the\nvalue it had for the last record read, unless a\nsubsequent, redirected,\ngetline\nfunction without a\nvar\nargument is performed prior to entering the\nEND\naction.\nNR\nThe ordinal number of the current record from the start\nof input.  Inside a\nBEGIN\naction the value shall be\nzero. Inside an\nEND\naction the value shall be the number\nof the last record processed.\nOFMT\nThe\nprintf\nformat for converting numbers to strings in\noutput statements (see\nOutput Statements\n);\n\"%.6g\"\nby\ndefault. The result of the conversion is unspecified if\nthe value of\nOFMT\nis not a floating-point format\nspecification.\nOFS\nThe\nprint\nstatement output field separator; <space> by\ndefault.\nORS\nThe\nprint\nstatement output record separator; a <newline>\nby default.\nRLENGTH\nThe length of the string matched by the\nmatch\nfunction.\nRS\nThe first character of the string value of\nRS\nshall be\nthe input record separator; a <newline> by default. If\nRS\ncontains more than one character, the results are\nunspecified. If\nRS\nis null, then records are separated\nby sequences consisting of a <newline> plus one or more\nblank lines, leading or trailing blank lines shall not\nresult in empty records at the beginning or end of the\ninput, and a <newline> shall always be a field\nseparator, no matter what the value of\nFS\nis.\nRSTART\nThe starting position of the string matched by the\nmatch\nfunction, numbering from 1. This shall always be\nequivalent to the return value of the\nmatch\nfunction.\nSUBSEP\nThe subscript separator string for multi-dimensional\narrays; the default value is implementation-defined.\nRegular Expressions\nThe\nawk\nutility shall make use of the extended regular expression\nnotation (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nSection\n9.4\n,\nExtended Regular Expressions\n) except that it shall allow the\nuse of C-language conventions for escaping special characters\nwithin the EREs, as specified in the table in the Base Definitions\nvolume of POSIX.1â2017,\nChapter 5\n,\nFile Format Notation\n(\n'\\\\'\n,\n'\\a'\n,\n'\\b'\n,\n'\\f'\n,\n'\\n'\n,\n'\\r'\n,\n'\\t'\n,\n'\\v'\n) and the following table;\nthese escape sequences shall be recognized both inside and outside\nbracket expressions. Note that records need not be separated by\n<newline> characters and string constants can contain <newline>\ncharacters, so even the\n\"\\n\"\nsequence is valid in\nawk\nEREs. Using\na <slash> character within an ERE requires the escaping shown in\nthe following table.\nTable 4-2: Escape Sequences in\nawk\nââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ\nâ\nEscape\nâ                                    â                                    â\nâ\nSequence\nâ\nDescription\nâ\nMeaning\nâ\nââââââââââââ¼âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¼âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¤\nâ \\\"       â <backslash> <quotation-mark>       â <quotation-mark> character         â\nââââââââââââ¼âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¼âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¤\nâ \\/       â <backslash> <slash>                â <slash> character                  â\nââââââââââââ¼âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¼âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¤\nâ \\ddd     â A <backslash> character followed   â The character whose encoding is    â\nâ          â by the longest sequence of one,    â represented by the one, two, or    â\nâ          â two, or three octal-digit          â three-digit octal integer.

These operators shall interpret their\nright-hand operand as a regular  expression  and  their  left-hand\noperand as a string. If the regular expression matches the string,\nthe\n'~'\nexpression  shall evaluate to a value of 1, and the\n\"!~\"\nexpression shall evaluate to a value of 0. (The regular expression\nmatching operation is as defined by the term matched in  the  Base\nDefinitions   volume   of   POSIX.1â2017,\nSection\n9.1\n,\nRegular\nExpression Definitions\n, where a match occurs on any  part  of  the\nstring   unless   the  regular  expression  is  limited  with  the\n<circumflex> or <dollar-sign> special characters.) If the  regular\nexpression  does  not  match  the string, the\n'~'\nexpression shall\nevaluate to a value of 0, and the\n\"!~\"\nexpression  shall  evaluate\nto a value of 1. If the right-hand operand is any expression other\nthan  the  lexical  token\nERE\n, the string value of the expression\nshall be interpreted as an extended regular expression,  including\nthe  escape  conventions  described  above.   Note that these same\nescape conventions shall also be applied in determining the  value\nof  a string literal (the lexical token\nSTRING\n), and thus shall be\napplied a second time when  a  string  literal  is  used  in  this\ncontext.\nWhen  an\nERE\ntoken appears as an expression in any context other\nthan as the right-hand of the\n'~'\nor\n\"!~\"\noperator or  as  one  of\nthe  built-in function arguments described below, the value of the\nresulting expression shall be the equivalent of:\n$0 ~ /\nere\n/\nThe\nere\nargument to the\ngsub\n,\nmatch\n,\nsub\nfunctions,  and  the\nfs\nargument  to  the\nsplit\nfunction (see\nString Functions\n) shall be\ninterpreted as extended regular expressions. These can  be  either\nERE\ntokens  or arbitrary expressions, and shall be interpreted in\nthe same manner  as  the  right-hand  side  of  the\n'~'\nor\n\"!~\"\noperator.\nAn  extended  regular expression can be used to separate fields by\nassigning a string  containing  the  expression  to  the  built-in\nvariable\nFS\n,  either directly or as a consequence of using the\n-F\nsepstring\noption.  The default value of the\nFS\nvariable shall be a\nsingle <space>.  The following describes\nFS\nbehavior:\n1. If\nFS\nis a null string, the behavior is unspecified.\n2. If\nFS\nis a single character:\na. If\nFS\nis <space>, skip leading and trailing <blank> and\n<newline> characters; fields shall be delimited by sets of\none or more <blank> or <newline> characters.\nb. Otherwise, if\nFS\nis any other character\nc\n, fields shall be\ndelimited by each single occurrence of\nc\n.\n3. Otherwise, the string value of\nFS\nshall be considered to be an\nextended regular expression. Each occurrence of a sequence\nmatching the extended regular expression shall delimit fields.\nExcept for the\n'~'\nand\n\"!~\"\noperators, and in the\ngsub\n,\nmatch\n,\nsplit\n, and\nsub\nbuilt-in functions, ERE matching shall be based on\ninput records; that is, record separator characters (the first\ncharacter of the value of the variable\nRS\n, <newline> by default)\ncannot be embedded in the expression, and no expression shall\nmatch the record separator character. If the record separator is\nnot <newline>, <newline> characters embedded in the expression can\nbe matched. For the\n'~'\nand\n\"!~\"\noperators, and in those four\nbuilt-in functions, ERE matching shall be based on text strings;\nthat is, any character (including <newline> and the record\nseparator) can be embedded in the pattern, and an appropriate\npattern shall match any character. However, in all\nawk\nERE\nmatching, the use of one or more NUL characters in the pattern,\ninput record, or text string produces undefined results.\nPatterns\nA\npattern\nis any valid\nexpression\n, a range specified by two\nexpressions separated by a comma, or one of the two special\npatterns\nBEGIN\nor\nEND\n.\nSpecial Patterns\nThe\nawk\nutility shall recognize two special patterns,\nBEGIN\nand\nEND\n.  Each\nBEGIN\npattern shall be matched once and its associated\naction executed before the first record of input is readâexcept\npossibly by use of the\ngetline\nfunction (see\nInput/Output and\nGeneral Functions\n) in a prior\nBEGIN\nactionâand before command line\nassignment is done. Each\nEND\npattern shall be matched once and its\nassociated action executed after the last record of input has been\nread. These two patterns shall have associated actions.\nBEGIN\nand\nEND\nshall not combine with other patterns. Multiple\nBEGIN\nand\nEND\npatterns shall be allowed. The actions associated\nwith the\nBEGIN\npatterns shall be executed in the order specified\nin the program, as are the\nEND\nactions. An\nEND\npattern can precede\na\nBEGIN\npattern in a program.\nIf an\nawk\nprogram consists of only actions with the pattern\nBEGIN\n,\nand the\nBEGIN\naction contains no\ngetline\nfunction,\nawk\nshall exit\nwithout reading its input when the last statement in the last\nBEGIN\naction is executed. If an\nawk\nprogram consists of only\nactions with the pattern\nEND\nor only actions with the patterns\nBEGIN\nand\nEND\n, the input shall be read before the statements in\nthe\nEND\nactions are executed.\nExpression Patterns\nAn expression pattern shall be evaluated as if it were an\nexpression in a Boolean context. If the result is true, the\npattern shall be considered to match, and the associated action\n(if any) shall be executed. If the result is false, the action\nshall not be executed.\nPattern Ranges\nA pattern range consists of two expressions separated by a comma;\nin this case, the action shall be performed for all records\nbetween a match of the first expression and the following match of\nthe second expression, inclusive. At this point, the pattern range\ncan be repeated starting at input records subsequent to the end of\nthe matched range.\nActions\nAn action is a sequence of statements as shown in the grammar in\nGrammar\n.  Any single statement can be replaced by a statement list\nenclosed in curly braces. The application shall ensure that\nstatements in a statement list are separated by <newline> or\n<semicolon> characters. Statements in a statement list shall be\nexecuted sequentially in the order that they appear.\nThe\nexpression\nacting as the conditional in an\nif\nstatement shall\nbe evaluated and if it is non-zero or non-null, the following\nstatement shall be executed; otherwise, if\nelse\nis present, the\nstatement following the\nelse\nshall be executed.\nThe\nif\n,\nwhile\n,\ndo\n...\nwhile\n,\nfor\n,\nbreak\n, and\ncontinue\nstatements are\nbased on the ISO C standard (see\nSection 1.1.2\n,\nConcepts Derived\nfrom the ISO C Standard\n), except that the Boolean expressions\nshall be treated as described in\nExpressions in awk\n, and except in\nthe case of:\nfor (\nvariable\nin\narray\n)\nwhich shall iterate, assigning each\nindex\nof\narray\nto\nvariable\nin\nan unspecified order. The results of adding new elements to\narray\nwithin such a\nfor\nloop are undefined. If a\nbreak\nor\ncontinue\nstatement occurs outside of a loop, the behavior is undefined.\nThe\ndelete\nstatement shall remove an individual array element.\nThus, the following code deletes an entire array:\nfor (index in array)\ndelete array[index]\nThe\nnext\nstatement shall cause all further processing of the\ncurrent input record to be abandoned. The behavior is undefined if\na\nnext\nstatement appears or is invoked in a\nBEGIN\nor\nEND\naction.\nThe\nexit\nstatement shall invoke all\nEND\nactions in the order in\nwhich they occur in the program source and then terminate the\nprogram without reading further input. An\nexit\nstatement inside an\nEND\naction shall terminate the program without further execution\nof\nEND\nactions. If an expression is specified in an\nexit\nstatement, its numeric value shall be the exit status of\nawk\n,\nunless subsequent errors are encountered or a subsequent\nexit\nstatement with an expression is executed.\nOutput Statements\nBoth\nprint\nand\nprintf\nstatements shall write to standard output by\ndefault. The output shall be written to the location specified by\noutput_redirection\nif one is supplied, as follows:\n>\nexpression\n>>\nexpression\n|\nexpression\nIn all cases, the\nexpression\nshall be evaluated to produce a\nstring that is used as a pathname into which to write (for\n'>'\nor\n\">>\"\n) or as a command to be executed (for\n'|'\n).  Using the first\ntwo forms, if the file of that name is not currently open, it\nshall be opened, creating it if necessary and using the first\nform, truncating the file. The output then shall be appended to\nthe file. As long as the file remains open, subsequent calls in\nwhich\nexpression\nevaluates to the same string value shall simply\nappend output to the file. The file remains open until the\nclose\nfunction (see\nInput/Output and General Functions\n) is called with\nan expression that evaluates to the same string value.\nThe third form shall write output onto a stream piped to the input\nof a command. The stream shall be created if no stream is\ncurrently open with the value of\nexpression\nas its command name.\nThe stream created shall be equivalent to one created by a call to\nthe\npopen\n() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of\nPOSIX.1â2017 with the value of\nexpression\nas the\ncommand\nargument\nand a value of\nw\nas the\nmode\nargument. As long as the stream\nremains open, subsequent calls in which\nexpression\nevaluates to\nthe same string value shall write output to the existing stream.\nThe stream shall remain open until the\nclose\nfunction (see\nInput/Output and General Functions\n) is called with an expression\nthat evaluates to the same string value.  At that time, the stream\nshall be closed as if by a call to the\npclose\n() function defined\nin the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1â2017.\nAs described in detail by the grammar in\nGrammar\n, these output\nstatements shall take a <comma>-separated list of\nexpression\ns\nreferred to in the grammar by the non-terminal symbols\nexpr_list\n,\nprint_expr_list\n, or\nprint_expr_list_opt\n.  This list is referred to\nhere as the\nexpression list\n, and each member is referred to as an\nexpression argument\n.\nThe\nprint\nstatement shall write the value of each expression\nargument onto the indicated output stream separated by the current\noutput field separator (see variable\nOFS\nabove), and terminated by\nthe output record separator (see variable\nORS\nabove). All\nexpression arguments shall be taken as strings, being converted if\nnecessary; this conversion shall be as described in\nExpressions in\nawk\n, with the exception that the\nprintf\nformat in\nOFMT\nshall be\nused instead of the value in\nCONVFMT\n.  An empty expression list\nshall stand for the whole input record ($0).\nThe\nprintf\nstatement shall produce output based on a notation\nsimilar to the File Format Notation used to describe file formats\nin this volume of POSIX.1â2017 (see the Base Definitions volume of\nPOSIX.1â2017,\nChapter 5\n,\nFile Format Notation\n).  Output shall be\nproduced as specified with the first\nexpression\nargument as the\nstring\nformat\nand subsequent\nexpression\narguments as the strings\narg1\nto\nargn\n, inclusive, with the following exceptions:\n1. The\nformat\nshall be an actual character string rather than a\ngraphical representation. Therefore, it cannot contain empty\ncharacter positions. The <space> in the\nformat\nstring, in any\ncontext other than a\nflag\nof a conversion specification, shall\nbe treated as an ordinary character that is copied to the\noutput.\n2. If the character set contains a\n'\n' character and that\ncharacter appears in the\nformat\nstring, it shall be treated as\nan ordinary character that is copied to the output.\n3. The\nescape sequences\nbeginning with a <backslash> character\nshall be treated as sequences of ordinary characters that are\ncopied to the output. Note that these same sequences shall be\ninterpreted lexically by\nawk\nwhen they appear in literal\nstrings, but they shall not be treated specially by the\nprintf\nstatement.\n4. A\nfield width\nor\nprecision\ncan be specified as the\n'*'\ncharacter instead of a digit string. In this case the next\nargument from the expression list shall be fetched and its\nnumeric value taken as the field width or precision.\n5. The implementation shall not precede or follow output from the\nd\nor\nu\nconversion specifier characters with <blank> characters\nnot specified by the\nformat\nstring.\n6. The implementation shall not precede output from the\no\nconversion specifier character with leading zeros not\nspecified by the\nformat\nstring.\n7. For the\nc\nconversion specifier character: if the argument has\na numeric value, the character whose encoding is that value\nshall be output. If the value is zero or is not the encoding\nof any character in the character set, the behavior is\nundefined. If the argument does not have a numeric value, the\nfirst character of the string value shall be output; if the\nstring does not contain any characters, the behavior is\nundefined.\n8. For each conversion specification that consumes an argument,\nthe next expression argument shall be evaluated. With the\nexception of the\nc\nconversion specifier character, the value\nshall be converted (according to the rules specified in\nExpressions in awk\n) to the appropriate type for the conversion\nspecification.\n9. If there are insufficient expression arguments to satisfy all\nthe conversion specifications in the\nformat\nstring, the\nbehavior is undefined.\n10. If any character sequence in the\nformat\nstring begins with a\n'%'\ncharacter, but does not form a valid conversion\nspecification, the behavior is unspecified.\nBoth\nprint\nand\nprintf\ncan output at least {LINE_MAX} bytes.\nFunctions\nThe\nawk\nlanguage has a variety of built-in functions: arithmetic,\nstring, input/output, and general.\nArithmetic Functions\nThe arithmetic functions, except for\nint\n, shall be based on the\nISO C standard (see\nSection 1.1.2\n,\nConcepts Derived from the ISO C\nStandard\n).  The behavior is undefined in cases where the ISO C\nstandard specifies that an error be returned or that the behavior\nis undefined. Although the grammar (see\nGrammar\n) permits built-in\nfunctions to appear with no arguments or parentheses, unless the\nargument or parentheses are indicated as optional in the following\nlist (by displaying them within the\n\"[]\"\nbrackets), such use is\nundefined.\natan2\n(\ny\n,\nx\n)\nReturn arctangent of\ny\n/\nx\nin radians in the range [-Ï,Ï].\ncos\n(\nx\n)    Return cosine of\nx\n, where\nx\nis in radians.\nsin\n(\nx\n)    Return sine of\nx\n, where\nx\nis in radians.\nexp\n(\nx\n)    Return the exponential function of\nx\n.\nlog\n(\nx\n)    Return the natural logarithm of\nx\n.\nsqrt\n(\nx\n)   Return the square root of\nx\n.\nint\n(\nx\n)    Return the argument truncated to an integer. Truncation\nshall be toward 0 when\nx\n>0.\nrand\n()    Return a random number\nn\n, such that 0â¤\nn\n<1.\nsrand\n(\n[\nexpr\n]\n)\nSet the seed value for\nrand\nto\nexpr\nor use the time of\nday if\nexpr\nis omitted. The previous seed value shall be\nreturned.\nString Functions\nThe string functions in the following list shall be supported.\nAlthough the grammar (see\nGrammar\n) permits built-in functions to\nappear with no arguments or parentheses, unless the argument or\nparentheses are indicated as optional in the following list (by\ndisplaying them within the\n\"[]\"\nbrackets), such use is undefined.\ngsub\n(\nere\n,\nrepl\n[\n,\nin\n]\n)\nBehave like\nsub\n(see below), except that it shall\nreplace all occurrences of the regular expression (like\nthe\ned\nutility global substitute) in $0 or in the\nin\nargument, when specified.\nindex\n(\ns\n,\nt\n)\nReturn the position, in characters, numbering from 1, in\nstring\ns\nwhere string\nt\nfirst occurs, or zero if it does\nnot occur at all.\nlength[\n(\n[\ns\n]\n)\n]\nReturn the length, in characters, of its argument taken\nas a string, or of the whole record, $0, if there is no\nargument.\nmatch\n(\ns\n,\nere\n)\nReturn the position, in characters, numbering from 1, in\nstring\ns\nwhere the extended regular expression\nere\noccurs, or zero if it does not occur at all. RSTART\nshall be set to the starting position (which is the same\nas the returned value), zero if no match is found;\nRLENGTH shall be set to the length of the matched\nstring, -1 if no match is found.\nsplit\n(\ns\n,\na\n[\n,\nfs\n]\n)\nSplit the string\ns\ninto array elements\na\n[1],\na\n[2], ...,\na\n[\nn\n], and return\nn\n.  All elements of the array shall be\ndeleted before the split is performed. The separation\nshall be done with the ERE\nfs\nor with the field\nseparator\nFS\nif\nfs\nis not given. Each array element\nshall have a string value when created and, if\nappropriate, the array element shall be considered a\nnumeric string (see\nExpressions in awk\n).  The effect of\na null string as the value of\nfs\nis unspecified.\nsprintf\n(\nfmt\n,\nexpr\n,\nexpr\n, ...)\nFormat the expressions according to the\nprintf\nformat\ngiven by\nfmt\nand return the resulting string.\nsub(\nere\n,\nrepl\n[\n,\nin\n]\n)\nSubstitute the string\nrepl\nin place of the first\ninstance of the extended regular expression\nERE\nin\nstring\nin\nand return the number of substitutions. An\n<ampersand> (\n'&'\n) appearing in the string\nrepl\nshall be\nreplaced by the string from\nin\nthat matches the ERE. An\n<ampersand> preceded with a <backslash> shall be\ninterpreted as the literal <ampersand> character. An\noccurrence of two consecutive <backslash> characters\nshall be interpreted as just a single literal\n<backslash> character. Any other occurrence of a\n<backslash> (for example, preceding any other character)\nshall be treated as a literal <backslash> character.\nNote that if\nrepl\nis a string literal (the lexical token\nSTRING\n; see\nGrammar\n), the handling of the <ampersand>\ncharacter occurs after any lexical processing, including\nany lexical <backslash>-escape sequence processing. If\nin\nis specified and it is not an lvalue (see\nExpressions\nin awk\n), the behavior is undefined. If\nin\nis omitted,\nawk\nshall use the current record ($0) in its place.\nsubstr\n(\ns\n,\nm\n[\n,\nn\n]\n)\nReturn the at most\nn\n-character substring of\ns\nthat\nbegins at position\nm\n, numbering from 1. If\nn\nis omitted,\nor if\nn\nspecifies more characters than are left in the\nstring, the length of the substring shall be limited by\nthe length of the string\ns\n.\ntolower\n(\ns\n)\nReturn a string based on the string\ns\n.  Each character\nin\ns\nthat is an uppercase letter specified to have a\ntolower\nmapping by the\nLC_CTYPE\ncategory of the current\nlocale shall be replaced in the returned string by the\nlowercase letter specified by the mapping. Other\ncharacters in\ns\nshall be unchanged in the returned\nstring.\ntoupper\n(\ns\n)\nReturn a string based on the string\ns\n.  Each character\nin\ns\nthat is a lowercase letter specified to have a\ntoupper\nmapping by the\nLC_CTYPE\ncategory of the current\nlocale is replaced in the returned string by the\nuppercase letter specified by the mapping. Other\ncharacters in\ns\nare unchanged in the returned string.\nAll of the preceding functions that take\nERE\nas a parameter expect\na pattern or a string valued expression that is a regular\nexpression as defined in\nRegular Expressions\n.\nInput/Output and General Functions\nThe input/output and general functions are:\nclose\n(\nexpression\n)\nClose the file or pipe opened by a\nprint\nor\nprintf\nstatement or a call to\ngetline\nwith the same string-\nvalued\nexpression\n.  The limit on the number of open\nexpression\narguments is implementation-defined. If the\nclose was successful, the function shall return zero;\notherwise, it shall return non-zero.\nexpression |\ngetline [\nvar\n]\nRead a record of input from a stream piped from the\noutput of a command. The stream shall be created if no\nstream is currently open with the value of\nexpression\nas\nits command name. The stream created shall be equivalent\nto one created by a call to the\npopen\n() function with\nthe value of\nexpression\nas the\ncommand\nargument and a\nvalue of\nr\nas the\nmode\nargument. As long as the stream\nremains open, subsequent calls in which\nexpression\nevaluates to the same string value shall read subsequent\nrecords from the stream. The stream shall remain open\nuntil the\nclose\nfunction is called with an expression\nthat evaluates to the same string value. At that time,\nthe stream shall be closed as if by a call to the\npclose\n() function. If\nvar\nis omitted, $0 and\nNF\nshall be\nset; otherwise,\nvar\nshall be set and, if appropriate, it\nshall be considered a numeric string (see\nExpressions in\nawk\n).\nThe\ngetline\noperator can form ambiguous constructs when\nthere are unparenthesized operators (including\nconcatenate) to the left of the\n'|'\n(to the beginning of\nthe expression containing\ngetline\n).  In the context of\nthe\n'$'\noperator,\n'|'\nshall behave as if it had a lower\nprecedence than\n'$'\n.  The result of evaluating other\noperators is unspecified, and conforming applications\nshall parenthesize properly all such usages.\ngetline\nSet $0 to the next input record from the current input\nfile. This form of\ngetline\nshall set the\nNF\n,\nNR\n, and\nFNR\nvariables.\ngetline\nvar\nSet variable\nvar\nto the next input record from the\ncurrent input file and, if appropriate,\nvar\nshall be\nconsidered a numeric string (see\nExpressions in awk\n).\nThis form of\ngetline\nshall set the\nFNR\nand\nNR\nvariables.\ngetline [\nvar\n]\n<\nexpression\nRead the next record of input from a named file. The\nexpression\nshall be evaluated to produce a string that\nis used as a pathname.  If the file of that name is not\ncurrently open, it shall be opened. As long as the\nstream remains open, subsequent calls in which\nexpression\nevaluates to the same string value shall read\nsubsequent records from the file. The file shall remain\nopen until the\nclose\nfunction is called with an\nexpression that evaluates to the same string value. If\nvar\nis omitted, $0 and\nNF\nshall be set; otherwise,\nvar\nshall be set and, if appropriate, it shall be considered\na numeric string (see\nExpressions in awk\n).\nThe\ngetline\noperator can form ambiguous constructs when\nthere are unparenthesized binary operators (including\nconcatenate) to the right of the\n'<'\n(up to the end of\nthe expression containing the\ngetline\n).  The result of\nevaluating such a construct is unspecified, and\nconforming applications shall parenthesize properly all\nsuch usages.\nsystem\n(\nexpression\n)\nExecute the command given by\nexpression\nin a manner\nequivalent to the\nsystem\n() function defined in the\nSystem Interfaces volume of POSIX.1â2017 and return the\nexit status of the command.\nAll forms of\ngetline\nshall return 1 for successful input, zero for\nend-of-file, and -1 for an error.\nWhere strings are used as the name of a file or pipeline, the\napplication shall ensure that the strings are textually identical.\nThe terminology ``same string value'' implies that ``equivalent\nstrings'', even those that differ only by <space> characters,\nrepresent different files.\nUser-Defined Functions\nThe\nawk\nlanguage also provides user-defined functions. Such\nfunctions can be defined as:\nfunction\nname\n(\n[\nparameter\n, ...\n]\n) {\nstatements\n}\nA function can be referred to anywhere in an\nawk\nprogram; in\nparticular, its use can precede its definition. The scope of a\nfunction is global.\nFunction parameters, if present, can be either scalars or arrays;\nthe behavior is undefined if an array name is passed as a\nparameter that the function uses as a scalar, or if a scalar\nexpression is passed as a parameter that the function uses as an\narray. Function parameters shall be passed by value if scalar and\nby reference if array name.\nThe number of parameters in the function definition need not match\nthe number of parameters in the function call. Excess formal\nparameters can be used as local variables. If fewer arguments are\nsupplied in a function call than are in the function definition,\nthe extra parameters that are used in the function body as scalars\nshall evaluate to the uninitialized value until they are otherwise\ninitialized, and the extra parameters that are used in the\nfunction body as arrays shall be treated as uninitialized arrays\nwhere each element evaluates to the uninitialized value until\notherwise initialized.\nWhen invoking a function, no white space can be placed between the\nfunction name and the opening parenthesis. Function calls can be\nnested and recursive calls can be made upon functions. Upon return\nfrom any nested or recursive function call, the values of all of\nthe calling function's parameters shall be unchanged, except for\narray parameters passed by reference. The\nreturn\nstatement can be\nused to return a value. If a\nreturn\nstatement appears outside of a\nfunction definition, the behavior is undefined.\nIn the function definition, <newline> characters shall be optional\nbefore the opening brace and after the closing brace. Function\ndefinitions can appear anywhere in the program where a\npattern-\naction\npair is allowed.\nGrammar\nThe grammar in this section and the lexical conventions in the\nfollowing section shall together describe the syntax for\nawk\nprograms. The general conventions for this style of grammar are\ndescribed in\nSection 1.3\n,\nGrammar Conventions\n.  A valid program\ncan be represented as the non-terminal symbol\nprogram\nin the\ngrammar. This formal syntax shall take precedence over the\npreceding text syntax description.\n%token NAME NUMBER STRING ERE\n%token FUNC_NAME   /* Name followed by '(' without white space. */\n/* Keywords */\n%token       Begin   End\n/*          'BEGIN' 'END'                            */\n%token       Break   Continue   Delete   Do   Else\n/*          'break' 'continue' 'delete' 'do' 'else'  */\n%token       Exit   For   Function   If   In\n/*          'exit' 'for' 'function' 'if' 'in'        */\n%token       Next   Print   Printf   Return   While\n/*          'next' 'print' 'printf' 'return' 'while' */\n/* Reserved function names */\n%token BUILTIN_FUNC_NAME\n/* One token for the following:\n* atan2 cos sin exp log sqrt int rand srand\n* gsub index length match split sprintf sub\n* substr tolower toupper close system\n*/\n%token GETLINE\n/* Syntactically different from other built-ins. */\n/* Two-character tokens. */\n%token ADD_ASSIGN SUB_ASSIGN MUL_ASSIGN DIV_ASSIGN MOD_ASSIGN POW_ASSIGN\n/*     '+='       '-='       '*='       '/='       '%='       '^=' */\n%token OR   AND  NO_MATCH   EQ   LE   GE   NE   INCR  DECR  APPEND\n/*     '||' '&&' '!~' '==' '<=' '>=' '!=' '++'  '--'  '>>'   */\n/* One-character tokens. */\n%token '{' '}' '(' ')' '[' ']' ',' ';' NEWLINE\n%token '+' '-' '*' '%' '^' '!'

ambiguities that shall be resolved as\nfollows:\n*  Operator precedence and associativity shall be as described in\nTable 4-1, Expressions in Decreasing Precedence in awk\n.\n*  In case of ambiguity, an\nelse\nshall be associated with the\nmost immediately preceding\nif\nthat would satisfy the grammar.\n*  In some contexts, a <slash> (\n'/'\n) that is used to surround an\nERE could also be the division operator.  This shall be\nresolved in such a way that wherever the division operator\ncould appear, a <slash> is assumed to be the division\noperator. (There is no unary division operator.)\nEach expression in an\nawk\nprogram shall conform to the precedence\nand associativity rules, even when this is not needed to resolve\nan ambiguity. For example, because\n'$'\nhas higher precedence than\n'++'\n, the string\n\"$x++--\"\nis not a valid\nawk\nexpression, even\nthough it is unambiguously parsed by the grammar as\n\"$(x++)--\"\n.\nOne convention that might not be obvious from the formal grammar\nis where <newline> characters are acceptable. There are several\nobvious placements such as terminating a statement, and a\n<backslash> can be used to escape <newline> characters between any\nlexical tokens. In addition, <newline> characters without\n<backslash> characters can follow a comma, an open brace, logical\nAND operator (\n\"&&\"\n), logical OR operator (\n\"||\"\n), the\ndo\nkeyword,\nthe\nelse\nkeyword, and the closing parenthesis of an\nif\n,\nfor\n, or\nwhile\nstatement. For example:\n{ print  $1,\n$2 }\nLexical Conventions\nThe lexical conventions for\nawk\nprograms, with respect to the\npreceding grammar, shall be as follows:\n1. Except as noted,\nawk\nshall recognize the longest possible\ntoken or delimiter beginning at a given point.\n2. A comment shall consist of any characters beginning with the\n<number-sign> character and terminated by, but excluding the\nnext occurrence of, a <newline>.  Comments shall have no\neffect, except to delimit lexical tokens.\n3. The <newline> shall be recognized as the token\nNEWLINE\n.\n4. A <backslash> character immediately followed by a <newline>\nshall have no effect.\n5. The token\nSTRING\nshall represent a string constant. A string\nconstant shall begin with the character\n'\"'\n.  Within a string\nconstant, a <backslash> character shall be considered to begin\nan escape sequence as specified in the table in the Base\nDefinitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nChapter 5\n,\nFile Format\nNotation\n(\n'\\\\'\n,\n'\\a'\n,\n'\\b'\n,\n'\\f'\n,\n'\\n'\n,\n'\\r'\n,\n'\\t'\n,\n'\\v'\n).  In\naddition, the escape sequences in\nTable 4-2, Escape Sequences\nin awk\nshall be recognized. A <newline> shall not occur within\na string constant. A string constant shall be terminated by\nthe first unescaped occurrence of the character\n'\"'\nafter the\none that begins the string constant. The value of the string\nshall be the sequence of all unescaped characters and values\nof escape sequences between, but not including, the two\ndelimiting\n'\"'\ncharacters.\n6. The token\nERE\nrepresents an extended regular expression\nconstant. An ERE constant shall begin with the <slash>\ncharacter. Within an ERE constant, a <backslash> character\nshall be considered to begin an escape sequence as specified\nin the table in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nChapter 5\n,\nFile Format Notation\n.  In addition, the escape\nsequences in\nTable 4-2, Escape Sequences in awk\nshall be\nrecognized. The application shall ensure that a <newline> does\nnot occur within an ERE constant. An ERE constant shall be\nterminated by the first unescaped occurrence of the <slash>\ncharacter after the one that begins the ERE constant. The\nextended regular expression represented by the ERE constant\nshall be the sequence of all unescaped characters and values\nof escape sequences between, but not including, the two\ndelimiting <slash> characters.\n7. A <blank> shall have no effect, except to delimit lexical\ntokens or within\nSTRING\nor\nERE\ntokens.\n8. The token\nNUMBER\nshall represent a numeric constant. Its form\nand numeric value shall either be equivalent to the\ndecimal-\nfloating-constant\ntoken as specified by the ISO C standard, or\nit shall be a sequence of decimal digits and shall be\nevaluated as an integer constant in decimal. In addition,\nimplementations may accept numeric constants with the form and\nnumeric value equivalent to the\nhexadecimal-constant\nand\nhexadecimal-floating-constant\ntokens as specified by the ISO C\nstandard.\nIf the value is too large or too small to be representable\n(see\nSection 1.1.2\n,\nConcepts Derived from the ISO C Standard\n),\nthe behavior is undefined.\n9. A sequence of underscores, digits, and alphabetics from the\nportable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of\nPOSIX.1â2017,\nSection 6.1\n,\nPortable Character Set\n), beginning\nwith an <underscore> or alphabetic character, shall be\nconsidered a word.\n10. The following words are keywords that shall be recognized as\nindividual tokens; the name of the token is the same as the\nkeyword:\nBEGIN      delete     END        function   in         printf\nbreak      do         exit       getline    next       return\ncontinue   else       for        if         print      while\n11. The following words are names of built-in functions and shall\nbe recognized as the token\nBUILTIN_FUNC_NAME\n:\natan2     gsub      log       split     sub       toupper\nclose     index     match     sprintf   substr\ncos       int       rand      sqrt      system\nexp       length    sin       srand     tolower\nThe above-listed keywords and names of built-in functions are\nconsidered reserved words.\n12. The token\nNAME\nshall consist of a word that is not a keyword\nor a name of a built-in function and is not followed\nimmediately (without any delimiters) by the\n'('\ncharacter.\n13. The token\nFUNC_NAME\nshall consist of a word that is not a\nkeyword or a name of a built-in function, followed immediately\n(without any delimiters) by the\n'('\ncharacter. The\n'('\ncharacter shall not be included as part of the token.\n14.

When an input sequence begins with a <slash>\ncharacter in any syntactic context where the token\n'/'\nor\nDIV_ASSIGN\ncould appear as the next token in a valid program, the\nlonger of those two tokens that can be recognized shall be\nrecognized. In any other syntactic context where the token\nERE\ncould appear as the next token in a valid program, the token\nERE\nshall be recognized.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nThe following exit values shall be returned:\n0    All input files were processed successfully.\n>0    An error occurred.\nThe exit status can be altered within the program by using an\nexit\nexpression.\nCONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS\ntop\nIf any\nfile\noperand is specified and the named file cannot be\naccessed,\nawk\nshall write a diagnostic message to standard error\nand terminate without any further action.\nIf the program specified by either the\nprogram\noperand or a\nprogfile\noperand is not a valid\nawk\nprogram (as specified in the\nEXTENDED DESCRIPTION section), the behavior is undefined.\nThe following sections are informative.\nAPPLICATION USAGE\ntop\nThe\nindex\n,\nlength\n,\nmatch\n, and\nsubstr\nfunctions should not be\nconfused with similar functions in the ISO C standard; the\nawk\nversions deal with characters, while the ISO C standard deals with\nbytes.\nBecause the concatenation operation is represented by adjacent\nexpressions rather than an explicit operator, it is often\nnecessary to use parentheses to enforce the proper evaluation\nprecedence.\nWhen using\nawk\nto process pathnames, it is recommended that\nLC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or C\nin the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences\nthat do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case\nthe utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale\neach byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this\nproblem is avoided.\nOn implementations where the\n\"==\"\noperator checks if strings\ncollate equally, applications needing to check whether strings are\nidentical can use:\nlength(a) == length(b) && index(a,b) == 1\nOn implementations where the\n\"==\"\noperator checks if strings are\nidentical, applications needing to check whether strings collate\nequally can use:\na <= b && a >= b\nEXAMPLES\ntop\nThe\nawk\nprogram specified in the command line is most easily\nspecified within single-quotes (for example, '\nprogram\n') for\napplications using\nsh\n, because\nawk\nprograms commonly contain\ncharacters that are special to the shell, including double-quotes.\nIn the cases where an\nawk\nprogram contains single-quote\ncharacters, it is usually easiest to specify most of the program\nas strings within single-quotes concatenated by the shell with\nquoted single-quote characters. For example:\nawk '/'\\''/ { print \"quote:\", $0 }'\nprints all lines from the standard input containing a single-quote\ncharacter, prefixed with\nquote\n:.\nThe following are examples of simple\nawk\nprograms:\n1. Write to the standard output all input lines for which field 3\nis greater than 5:\n$3 > 5\n2. Write every tenth line:\n(NR % 10) == 0\n3. Write any line with a substring matching the regular\nexpression:\n/(G|D)(2[0-9][[:alpha:]]*)/\n4. Print any line with a substring containing a\n'G'\nor\n'D'\n,\nfollowed by a sequence of digits and characters. This example\nuses character classes\ndigit\nand\nalpha\nto match language-\nindependent digit and alphabetic characters respectively:\n/(G|D)([[:digit:][:alpha:]]*)/\n5. Write any line in which the second field matches the regular\nexpression and the fourth field does not:\n$2 ~ /xyz/ && $4 !~ /xyz/\n6. Write any line in which the second field contains a\n<backslash>:\n$2 ~ /\\\\/\n7. Write any line in which the second field contains a\n<backslash>.  Note that <backslash>-escapes are interpreted\ntwice; once in lexical processing of the string and once in\nprocessing the regular expression:\n$2 ~ \"\\\\\\\\\"\n8. Write the second to the last and the last field in each line.\nSeparate the fields by a <colon>:\n{OFS=\":\";print $(NF-1), $NF}\n9. Write the line number and number of fields in each line. The\nthree strings representing the line number, the <colon>, and\nthe number of fields are concatenated and that string is\nwritten to standard output:\n{print NR \":\" NF}\n10. Write lines longer than 72 characters:\nlength($0) > 72\n11. Write the first two fields in opposite order separated by\nOFS\n:\n{ print $2, $1 }\n12. Same, with input fields separated by a <comma> or <space> and\n<tab> characters, or both:\nBEGIN { FS = \",[ \\t]*|[ \\t]+\" }\n{ print $2, $1 }\n13. Add up the first column, print sum, and average:\n{s += $1 }\nEND   {print \"sum is \", s, \" average is\", s/NR}\n14. Write fields in reverse order, one per line (many lines out\nfor each line in):\n{ for (i = NF; i > 0; --i) print $i }\n15. Write all lines between occurrences of the strings\nstart\nand\nstop\n:\n/start/, /stop/\n16. Write all lines whose first field is different from the\nprevious one:\n$1 != prev { print; prev = $1 }\n17. Simulate\necho\n:\nBEGIN  {\nfor (i = 1; i < ARGC; ++i)\nprintf(\"%s%s\", ARGV[i], i==ARGC-1?\"\\n\":\" \")\n}\n18. Write the path prefixes contained in the\nPATH\nenvironment\nvariable, one per line:\nBEGIN  {\nn = split (ENVIRON[\"PATH\"], path, \":\")\nfor (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\nprint path[i]\n}\n19. If there is a file named\ninput\ncontaining page headers of the\nform: Page #\nand a file named\nprogram\nthat contains:\n/Page/   { $2 = n++; }\n{ print }\nthen the command line:\nawk -f program n=5 input\nprints the file\ninput\n, filling in page numbers starting at 5.\nRATIONALE\ntop\nThis description is based on the new\nawk\n, ``nawk'', (see the\nreferenced\nThe AWK Programming Language\n), which introduced a\nnumber of new features to the historical\nawk\n:\n1. New keywords:\ndelete\n,\ndo\n,\nfunction\n,\nreturn\n2. New built-in functions:\natan2\n,\nclose\n,\ncos\n,\ngsub\n,\nmatch\n,\nrand\n,\nsin\n,\nsrand\n,\nsub\n,\nsystem\n3. New predefined variables:\nFNR\n,\nARGC\n,\nARGV\n,\nRSTART\n,\nRLENGTH\n,\nSUBSEP\n4. New expression operators:\n?\n,\n:\n,\n,\n,\n^\n5. The\nFS\nvariable and the third argument to\nsplit\n, now treated\nas extended regular expressions.\n6. The operator precedence, changed to more closely match the C\nlanguage.  Two examples of code that operate differently are:\nwhile ( n /= 10 > 1) ...\nif (!\"wk\" ~ /bwk/) ...\nSeveral features have been added based on newer implementations of\nawk\n:\n*  Multiple instances of\n-f\nprogfile\nare permitted.\n*  The new option\n-v\nassignment.\n*  The new predefined variable\nENVIRON\n.\n*  New built-in functions\ntoupper\nand\ntolower\n.\n*  More formatting capabilities are added to\nprintf\nto match the\nISO C standard.\nEarlier versions of this standard required implementations to\nsupport multiple adjacent <semicolon>s, lines with one or more\n<semicolon> before a rule (\npattern-action\npairs), and lines with\nonly <semicolon>(s).  These are not required by this standard and\nare considered poor programming practice, but can be accepted by\nan implementation of\nawk\nas an extension.\nThe overall\nawk\nsyntax has always been based on the C language,\nwith a few features from the shell command language and other\nsources. Because of this, it is not completely compatible with any\nother language, which has caused confusion for some users. It is\nnot the intent of the standard developers to address such issues.\nA few relatively minor changes toward making the language more\ncompatible with the ISO C standard were made; most of these\nchanges are based on similar changes in recent implementations, as\ndescribed above. There remain several C-language conventions that\nare not in\nawk\n.  One of the notable ones is the <comma> operator,\nwhich is commonly used to specify multiple expressions in the C\nlanguage\nfor\nstatement. Also, there are various places where\nawk\nis more restrictive than the C language regarding the type of\nexpression that can be used in a given context. These limitations\nare due to the different features that the\nawk\nlanguage does\nprovide.\nRegular expressions in\nawk\nhave been extended somewhat from\nhistorical implementations to make them a pure superset of\nextended regular expressions, as defined by POSIX.1â2008 (see the\nBase Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nSection 9.4\n,\nExtended\nRegular Expressions\n).  The main extensions are\ninternationalization features and interval expressions. Historical\nimplementations of\nawk\nhave long supported <backslash>-escape\nsequences as an extension to extended regular expressions, and\nthis extension has been retained despite inconsistency with other\nutilities. The number of escape sequences recognized in both\nextended regular expressions and strings has varied (generally\nincreasing with time) among implementations. The set specified by\nPOSIX.1â2008 includes most sequences known to be supported by\npopular implementations and by the ISO C standard. One sequence\nthat is not supported is hexadecimal value escapes beginning with\n'\\x'\n.  This would allow values expressed in more than 9 bits to be\nused within\nawk\nas in the ISO C standard. However, because this\nsyntax has a non-deterministic length, it does not permit the\nsubsequent character to be a hexadecimal digit. This limitation\ncan be dealt with in the C language by the use of lexical string\nconcatenation. In the\nawk\nlanguage, concatenation could also be a\nsolution for strings, but not for extended regular expressions\n(either lexical ERE tokens or strings used dynamically as regular\nexpressions). Because of this limitation, the feature has not been\nadded to POSIX.1â2008.\nWhen a string variable is used in a context where an extended\nregular expression normally appears (where the lexical token ERE\nis used in the grammar) the string does not contain the literal\n<slash> characters.\nSome versions of\nawk\nallow the form:\nfunc name(args, ... ) { statements }\nThis has been deprecated by the authors of the language, who asked\nthat it not be specified.\nHistorical implementations of\nawk\nproduce an error if a\nnext\nstatement is executed in a\nBEGIN\naction, and cause\nawk\nto\nterminate if a\nnext\nstatement is executed in an\nEND\naction. This\nbehavior has not been documented, and it was not believed that it\nwas necessary to standardize it.\nThe specification of conversions between string and numeric values\nis much more detailed than in the documentation of historical\nimplementations or in the referenced\nThe AWK Programming Language\n.\nAlthough most of the behavior is designed to be intuitive, the\ndetails are necessary to ensure compatible behavior from different\nimplementations. This is especially important in relational\nexpressions since the types of the operands determine whether a\nstring or numeric comparison is performed. From the perspective of\nan application developer, it is usually sufficient to expect\nintuitive behavior and to force conversions (by adding zero or\nconcatenating a null string) when the type of an expression does\nnot obviously match what is needed. The intent has been to specify\nhistorical practice in almost all cases. The one exception is\nthat, in historical implementations, variables and constants\nmaintain both string and numeric values after their original value\nis converted by any use. This means that referencing a variable or\nconstant can have unexpected side-effects. For example, with\nhistorical implementations the following program:\n{\na = \"+2\"\nb = 2\nif (NR % 2)\nc = a + b\nif (a == b)\nprint \"numeric comparison\"\nelse\nprint \"string comparison\"\n}\nwould perform a numeric comparison (and output numeric comparison)\nfor each odd-numbered line, but perform a string comparison (and\noutput string comparison) for each even-numbered line.\nPOSIX.1â2008 ensures that comparisons will be numeric if\nnecessary. With historical implementations, the following program:\nBEGIN {\nOFMT = \"%e\"\nprint 3.14\nOFMT = \"%f\"\nprint 3.14\n}\nwould output\n\"3.140000e+00\"\ntwice, because in the second\nprint\nstatement the constant\n\"3.14\"\nwould have a string value from the\nprevious conversion. POSIX.1â2008 requires that the output of the\nsecond\nprint\nstatement be\n\"3.140000\"\n.  The behavior of historical\nimplementations was seen as too unintuitive and unpredictable.\nIt was pointed out that with the rules contained in early drafts,\nthe following script would print nothing:\nBEGIN {\ny[1.5] = 1\nOFMT = \"%e\"\nprint y[1.5]\n}\nTherefore, a new variable,\nCONVFMT\n, was introduced. The\nOFMT\nvariable is now restricted to affecting output conversions of\nnumbers to strings and\nCONVFMT\nis used for internal conversions,\nsuch as comparisons or array indexing. The default value is the\nsame as that for\nOFMT\n, so unless a program changes\nCONVFMT\n(which\nno historical program would do), it will receive the historical\nbehavior associated with internal string conversions.\nThe POSIX\nawk\nlexical and syntactic conventions are specified more\nformally than in other sources. Again the intent has been to\nspecify historical practice. One convention that may not be\nobvious from the formal grammar as in other verbal descriptions is\nwhere <newline> characters are acceptable. There are several\nobvious placements such as terminating a statement, and a\n<backslash> can be used to escape <newline> characters between any\nlexical tokens. In addition, <newline> characters without\n<backslash> characters can follow a comma, an open brace, a\nlogical AND operator (\n\"&&\"\n), a logical OR operator (\n\"||\"\n), the\ndo\nkeyword, the\nelse\nkeyword, and the closing parenthesis of an\nif\n,\nfor\n, or\nwhile\nstatement. For example:\n{ print $1,\n$2 }\nThe requirement that\nawk\nadd a trailing <newline> to the program\nargument text is to simplify the grammar, making it match a text\nfile in form. There is no way for an application or test suite to\ndetermine whether a literal <newline> is added or whether\nawk\nsimply acts as if it did.\nPOSIX.1â2008 requires several changes from historical\nimplementations in order to support internationalization. Probably\nthe most subtle of these is the use of the decimal-point\ncharacter, defined by the\nLC_NUMERIC\ncategory of the locale, in\nrepresentations of floating-point numbers.  This locale-specific\ncharacter is used in recognizing numeric input, in converting\nbetween strings and numeric values, and in formatting output.\nHowever, regardless of locale, the <period> character (the\ndecimal-point character of the POSIX locale) is the decimal-point\ncharacter recognized in processing\nawk\nprograms (including\nassignments in command line arguments). This is essentially the\nsame convention as the one used in the ISO C standard. The\ndifference is that the C language includes the\nsetlocale\n()\nfunction, which permits an application to modify its locale.\nBecause of this capability, a C application begins executing with\nits locale set to the C locale, and only executes in the\nenvironment-specified locale after an explicit call to\nsetlocale\n().  However, adding such an elaborate new feature to the\nawk\nlanguage was seen as inappropriate for POSIX.1â2008. It is\npossible to execute an\nawk\nprogram explicitly in any desired\nlocale by setting the environment in the shell.\nThe undefined behavior resulting from NULs in extended regular\nexpressions allows future extensions for the GNU\ngawk\nprogram to\nprocess binary data.\nThe behavior in the case of invalid\nawk\nprograms (including\nlexical, syntactic, and semantic errors) is undefined because it\nwas considered overly limiting on implementations to specify. In\nmost cases such errors can be expected to produce a diagnostic and\na non-zero exit status. However, some implementations may choose\nto extend the language in ways that make use of certain invalid\nconstructs. Other invalid constructs might be deemed worthy of a\nwarning, but otherwise cause some reasonable behavior. Still other\nconstructs may be very difficult to detect in some\nimplementations.  Also, different implementations might detect a\ngiven error during an initial parsing of the program (before\nreading any input files) while others might detect it when\nexecuting the program after reading some input. Implementors\nshould be aware that diagnosing errors as early as possible and\nproducing useful diagnostics can ease debugging of applications,\nand thus make an implementation more usable.\nThe unspecified behavior from using multi-character\nRS\nvalues is\nto allow possible future extensions based on extended regular\nexpressions used for record separators. Historical implementations\ntake the first character of the string and ignore the others.\nUnspecified behavior when\nsplit\n(\nstring\n,\narray\n,<null>) is used is to\nallow a proposed future extension that would split up a string\ninto an array of individual characters.\nIn the context of the\ngetline\nfunction, equally good arguments for\ndifferent precedences of the\n|\nand\n<\noperators can be made.\nHistorical practice has been that:\ngetline < \"a\" \"b\"\nis parsed as:\n( getline < \"a\" ) \"b\"\nalthough many would argue that the intent was that the file\nab\nshould be read. However:\ngetline < \"x\" + 1\nparses as:\ngetline < ( \"x\" + 1 )\nSimilar problems occur with the\n|\nversion of\ngetline\n, particularly\nin combination with\n$\n.  For example:\n$\"echo hi\" | getline\n(This situation is particularly problematic when used in a\nprint\nstatement, where the\n|getline\npart might be a redirection of the\nprint\n.)\nSince in most cases such constructs are not (or at least should\nnot) be used (because they have a natural ambiguity for which\nthere is no conventional parsing), the meaning of these constructs\nhas been made explicitly unspecified. (The effect is that a\nconforming application that runs into the problem must\nparenthesize to resolve the ambiguity.)  There appeared to be few\nif any actual uses of such constructs.\nGrammars can be written that would cause an error under these\ncircumstances. Where backwards-compatibility is not a large\nconsideration, implementors may wish to use such grammars.\nSome historical implementations have allowed some built-in\nfunctions to be called without an argument list, the result being\na default argument list chosen in some ``reasonable'' way. Use of\nlength\nas a synonym for\nlength($0)\nis the only one of these forms\nthat is thought to be widely known or widely used; this particular\nform is documented in various places (for example, most historical\nawk\nreference pages, although not in the referenced\nThe AWK\nProgramming Language\n) as legitimate practice.  With this\nexception, default argument lists have always been undocumented\nand vaguely defined, and it is not at all clear how (or if) they\nshould be generalized to user-defined functions. They add no\nuseful functionality and preclude possible future extensions that\nmight need to name functions without calling them. Not\nstandardizing them seems the simplest course. The standard\ndevelopers considered that\nlength\nmerited special treatment,\nhowever, since it has been documented in the past and sees\npossibly substantial use in historical programs.  Accordingly,\nthis usage has been made legitimate, but Issue 5 removed the\nobsolescent marking for XSI-conforming implementations and many\notherwise conforming applications depend on this feature.\nIn\nsub\nand\ngsub\n, if\nrepl\nis a string literal (the lexical token\nSTRING\n), then two consecutive <backslash> characters should be\nused in the string to ensure a single <backslash> will precede the\n<ampersand> when the resultant string is passed to the function.\n(For example, to specify one literal <ampersand> in the\nreplacement string, use\ngsub\n(\nERE\n,\n\"\\\\&\"\n).)\nHistorically, the only special character in the\nrepl\nargument of\nsub\nand\ngsub\nstring functions was the <ampersand> (\n'&'\n) character\nand preceding it with the <backslash> character was used to turn\noff its special meaning.\nThe description in the ISO POSIXâ2:1993 standard introduced\nbehavior such that the <backslash> character was another special\ncharacter and it was unspecified whether there were any other\nspecial characters. This description introduced several\nportability problems, some of which are described below, and so it\nhas been replaced with the more historical description. Some of\nthe problems include:\n*  Historically, to create the replacement string, a script could\nuse\ngsub\n(\nERE\n,\n\"\\\\&\"\n), but with the ISO POSIXâ2:1993 standard\nwording, it was necessary to use\ngsub\n(\nERE\n,\n\"\\\\\\\\&\"\n).  The\n<backslash> characters are doubled here because all string\nliterals are subject to lexical analysis, which would reduce\neach pair of <backslash> characters to a single <backslash>\nbefore being passed to\ngsub\n.\n*  Since it was unspecified what the special characters were, for\nportable scripts to guarantee that characters are printed\nliterally, each character had to be preceded with a\n<backslash>.  (For example, a portable script had to use\ngsub\n(\nERE\n,\n\"\\\\h\\\\i\"\n) to produce a replacement string of\n\"hi\"\n.)\nThe description for comparisons in the ISO POSIXâ2:1993 standard\ndid not properly describe historical practice because of the way\nnumeric strings are compared as numbers. The current rules cause\nthe following code:\nif (0 == \"000\")\nprint \"strange, but true\"\nelse\nprint \"not true\"\nto do a numeric comparison, causing the\nif\nto succeed. It should\nbe intuitively obvious that this is incorrect behavior, and\nindeed, no historical implementation of\nawk\nactually behaves this\nway.\nTo fix this problem, the definition of\nnumeric string\nwas enhanced\nto include only those values obtained from specific circumstances\n(mostly external sources) where it is not possible to determine\nunambiguously whether the value is intended to be a string or a\nnumeric.\nVariables that are assigned to a numeric string shall also be\ntreated as a numeric string. (For example, the notion of a numeric\nstring can be propagated across assignments.) In comparisons, all\nvariables having the uninitialized value are to be treated as a\nnumeric operand evaluating to the numeric value zero.\nUninitialized variables include all types of variables including\nscalars, array elements, and fields. The definition of an\nuninitialized value in\nVariables and Special Variables\nis\nnecessary to describe the value placed on uninitialized variables\nand on fields that are valid (for example,\n< $NF\n) but have no\ncharacters in them and to describe how these variables are to be\nused in comparisons. A valid field, such as\n$1\n, that has no\ncharacters in it can be obtained from an input line of\n\"\\t\\t\"\nwhen\nFS='\\t'\n.  Historically, the comparison (\n$1<\n10) was done\nnumerically after evaluating\n$1\nto the value zero.\nThe phrase ``... also shall have the numeric value of the numeric\nstring'' was removed from several sections of the ISO POSIXâ2:1993\nstandard because is specifies an unnecessary implementation\ndetail. It is not necessary for POSIX.1â2008 to specify that these\nobjects be assigned two different values.  It is only necessary to\nspecify that these objects may evaluate to two different values\ndepending on context.\nHistorical implementations of\nawk\ndid not parse hexadecimal\ninteger or floating constants like\n\"0xa\"\nand\n\"0xap0\"\n.  Due to an\noversight, the 2001 through 2004 editions of this standard\nrequired support for hexadecimal floating constants. This was due\nto the reference to\natof\n().  This version of the standard allows\nbut does not require implementations to use\natof\n() and includes a\ndescription of how floating-point numbers are recognized as an\nalternative to match historic behavior. The intent of this change\nis to allow implementations to recognize floating-point constants\naccording to either the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard or\nISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, and to allow (but not require)\nimplementations to recognize hexadecimal integer constants.\nHistorical implementations of\nawk\ndid not support floating-point\ninfinities and NaNs in\nnumeric strings\n; e.g.,\n\"-INF\"\nand\n\"NaN\"\n.\nHowever, implementations that use the\natof\n() or\nstrtod\n() functions\nto do the conversion picked up support for these values if they\nused a ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard version of the function instead\nof a ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard version. Due to an oversight, the\n2001 through 2004 editions of this standard did not allow support\nfor infinities and NaNs, but in this revision support is allowed\n(but not required). This is a silent change to the behavior of\nawk\nprograms; for example, in the POSIX locale the expression:\n(\"-INF\" + 0 < 0)\nformerly had the value 0 because\n\"-INF\"\nconverted to 0, but now it\nmay have the value 0 or 1.\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\ntop\nA future version of this standard may require the\n\"!=\"\nand\n\"==\"\noperators to perform string comparisons by checking if the strings\nare identical (and not by checking if they collate equally).\nSEE ALSO\ntop\nSection 1.3\n,\nGrammar Conventions\n,\ngrep(1p)\n,\nlex(1p)\n,\nsed(1p)\nThe Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nChapter 5\n,\nFile\nFormat Notation\n,\nSection 6.1\n,\nPortable Character Set\n,\nChapter 8\n,\nEnvironment Variables\n,\nChapter 9\n,\nRegular Expressions\n,\nSection\n12.2\n,\nUtility Syntax Guidelines\nThe System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1â2017,\natof(3p)\n,\nexec(1p)\n,\nisspace(3p)\n,\npopen(3p)\n,\nsetlocale(3p)\n,\nstrtod(3p)\nCOPYRIGHT\ntop\nPortions of this text are reprinted and reproduced in electronic\nform from IEEE Std 1003.1-2017, Standard for Information\nTechnology -- Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX), The\nOpen Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 Edition, Copyright\n(C) 2018 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,\nInc and The Open Group.

The script\nshall be obtained from either the\nscript\noperand string or a\ncombination of the option-arguments from the\n-e\nscript\nand\n-f\nscript_file\noptions.\nOPTIONS\ntop\nThe\nsed\nutility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of\nPOSIX.1â2017,\nSection 12.2\n,\nUtility Syntax Guidelines\n, except that\nthe order of presentation of the\n-e\nand\n-f\noptions is significant.\nThe following options shall be supported:\n-e\nscript\nAdd the editing commands specified by the\nscript\noption-\nargument to the end of the script of editing commands.\n-f\nscript_file\nAdd the editing commands in the file\nscript_file\nto the\nend of the script of editing commands.\n-n\nSuppress the default output (in which each line, after\nit is examined for editing, is written to standard\noutput). Only lines explicitly selected for output are\nwritten.\nIf any\n-e\nor\n-f\noptions are specified, the script of editing\ncommands shall initially be empty. The commands specified by each\n-e\nor\n-f\noption shall be added to the script in the order\nspecified. When each addition is made, if the previous addition\n(if any) was from a\n-e\noption, a <newline> shall be inserted\nbefore the new addition. The resulting script shall have the same\nproperties as the\nscript\noperand, described in the OPERANDS\nsection.\nOPERANDS\ntop\nThe following operands shall be supported:\nfile\nA pathname of a file whose contents are read and edited.\nIf multiple\nfile\noperands are specified, the named files\nshall be read in the order specified and the\nconcatenation shall be edited. If no\nfile\noperands are\nspecified, the standard input shall be used.\nscript\nA string to be used as the script of editing commands.\nThe application shall not present a\nscript\nthat violates\nthe restrictions of a text file except that the final\ncharacter need not be a <newline>.\nSTDIN\ntop\nThe standard input shall be used if no\nfile\noperands are\nspecified, and shall be used if a\nfile\noperand is\n'-'\nand the\nimplementation treats the\n'-'\nas meaning standard input.\nOtherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT\nFILES section.\nINPUT FILES\ntop\nThe input files shall be text files. The\nscript_file\ns named by the\n-f\noption shall consist of editing commands.\nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\ntop\nThe following environment variables shall affect the execution of\nsed\n:\nLANG\nProvide a default value for the internationalization\nvariables that are unset or null. (See the Base\nDefinitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nSection 8.2\n,\nInternationalization Variables\nfor the precedence of\ninternationalization variables used to determine the\nvalues of locale categories.)\nLC_ALL\nIf set to a non-empty string value, override the values\nof all the other internationalization variables.\nLC_COLLATE\nDetermine the locale for the behavior of ranges,\nequivalence classes, and multi-character collating\nelements within regular expressions.\nLC_CTYPE\nDetermine the locale for the interpretation of sequences\nof bytes of text data as characters (for example,\nsingle-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in\narguments and input files), and the behavior of\ncharacter classes within regular expressions.\nLC_MESSAGES\nDetermine the locale that should be used to affect the\nformat and contents of diagnostic messages written to\nstandard error.\nNLSPATH\nDetermine the location of message catalogs for the\nprocessing of\nLC_MESSAGES\n.\nASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS\ntop\nDefault.\nSTDOUT\ntop\nThe input files shall be written to standard output, with the\nediting commands specified in the script applied. If the\n-n\noption\nis specified, only those input lines selected by the script shall\nbe written to standard output.\nSTDERR\ntop\nThe standard error shall be used only for diagnostic and warning\nmessages.\nOUTPUT FILES\ntop\nThe output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent\non the editing commands given.\nEXTENDED DESCRIPTION\ntop\nThe\nscript\nshall consist of editing commands of the following\nform:\n[\naddress\n[\n,\naddress\n]]\nfunction\nwhere\nfunction\nrepresents a single-character command verb from the\nlist in\nEditing Commands in sed\n, followed by any applicable\narguments.\nThe command can be preceded by <blank> characters and/or\n<semicolon> characters. The function can be preceded by <blank>\ncharacters. These optional characters shall have no effect.\nIn default operation,\nsed\ncyclically shall append a line of input,\nless its terminating <newline> character, into the pattern space.\nReading from input shall be skipped if a <newline> was in the\npattern space prior to a\nD\ncommand ending the previous cycle. The\nsed\nutility shall then apply in sequence all commands whose\naddresses select that pattern space, until a command starts the\nnext cycle or quits. If no commands explicitly started a new\ncycle, then at the end of the script the pattern space shall be\ncopied to standard output (except when\n-n\nis specified) and the\npattern space shall be deleted. Whenever the pattern space is\nwritten to standard output or a named file,\nsed\nshall immediately\nfollow it with a <newline>.\nSome of the editing commands use a hold space to save all or part\nof the pattern space for subsequent retrieval. The pattern and\nhold spaces shall each be able to hold at least 8192 bytes.\nAddresses in sed\nAn address is either a decimal number that counts input lines\ncumulatively across files, a\n'$'\ncharacter that addresses the last\nline of input, or a context address (which consists of a BRE, as\ndescribed in\nRegular Expressions in sed\n, preceded and followed by\na delimiter, usually a <slash>).\nAn editing command with no addresses shall select every pattern\nspace.\nAn editing command with one address shall select each pattern\nspace that matches the address.\nAn editing command with two addresses shall select the inclusive\nrange from the first pattern space that matches the first address\nthrough the next pattern space that matches the second. (If the\nsecond address is a number less than or equal to the line number\nfirst selected, only one line shall be selected.) Starting at the\nfirst line following the selected range,\nsed\nshall look again for\nthe first address. Thereafter, the process shall be repeated.\nOmitting either or both of the address components in the following\nform produces undefined results:\n[\naddress\n[\n,\naddress\n]]\nRegular Expressions in sed\nThe\nsed\nutility shall support the BREs described in the Base\nDefinitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nSection 9.3\n,\nBasic Regular\nExpressions\n, with the following additions:\n*  In a context address, the construction\n\"\\cBREc\"\n, where\nc\nis\nany character other than <backslash> or <newline>, shall be\nidentical to\n\"/BRE/\"\n.  If the character designated by\nc\nappears following a <backslash>, then it shall be considered\nto be that literal character, which shall not terminate the\nBRE. For example, in the context address\n\"\\xabc\\xdefx\"\n, the\nsecond\nx\nstands for itself, so that the BRE is\n\"abcxdef\"\n.\n*  The escape sequence\n'\\n'\nshall match a <newline> embedded in\nthe pattern space. A literal <newline> shall not be used in\nthe BRE of a context address or in the substitute function.\n*  If an RE is empty (that is, no pattern is specified)\nsed\nshall\nbehave as if the last RE used in the last command applied\n(either as an address or as part of a substitute command) was\nspecified.\nEditing Commands in sed\nIn the following list of editing commands, the maximum number of\npermissible addresses for each function is indicated by [\n0addr\n],\n[\n1addr\n], or [\n2addr\n], representing zero, one, or two addresses.\nThe argument\ntext\nshall consist of one or more lines. Each\nembedded <newline> in the text shall be preceded by a <backslash>.\nOther <backslash> characters in text shall be removed, and the\nfollowing character shall be treated literally.\nThe\nr\nand\nw\ncommand verbs, and the\nw\nflag to the\ns\ncommand, take\nan\nrfile\n(or\nwfile\n) parameter, separated from the command verb\nletter or flag by one or more <blank> characters; implementations\nmay allow zero separation as an extension.\nThe argument\nrfile\nor the argument\nwfile\nshall terminate the\nediting command. Each\nwfile\nshall be created before processing\nbegins. Implementations shall support at least ten\nwfile\narguments\nin the script; the actual number (greater than or equal to 10)\nthat is supported by the implementation is unspecified. The use of\nthe\nwfile\nparameter shall cause that file to be initially created,\nif it does not exist, or shall replace the contents of an existing\nfile.\nThe\nb\n,\nr\n,\ns\n,\nt\n,\nw\n,\ny\n, and\n:\ncommand verbs shall accept additional\narguments. The following synopses indicate which arguments shall\nbe separated from the command verbs by a single <space>.\nThe\na\nand\nr\ncommands schedule text for later output. The text\nspecified for the\na\ncommand, and the contents of the file\nspecified for the\nr\ncommand, shall be written to standard output\njust before the next attempt to fetch a line of input when\nexecuting the\nN\nor\nn\ncommands, or when reaching the end of the\nscript. If written when reaching the end of the script, and the\n-n\noption was not specified, the text shall be written after copying\nthe pattern space to standard output. The contents of the file\nspecified for the\nr\ncommand shall be as of the time the output is\nwritten, not the time the\nr\ncommand is applied. The text shall be\noutput in the order in which the\na\nand\nr\ncommands were applied to\nthe input.\nEditing commands other than\n{...}\n,\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\ni\n,\nr\n,\nt\n,\nw\n,\n:\n, and\n#\ncan be followed by a <semicolon>, optional <blank> characters, and\nanother editing command. However, when an\ns\nediting command is\nused with the\nw\nflag, following it with another command in this\nmanner produces undefined results.\nA function can be preceded by a\n'!'\ncharacter, in which case the\nfunction shall be applied if the addresses do not select the\npattern space. Zero or more <blank> characters shall be accepted\nbefore the\n'!'\ncharacter. It is unspecified whether <blank>\ncharacters can follow the\n'!'\ncharacter, and conforming\napplications shall not follow the\n'!'\ncharacter with <blank>\ncharacters.\nIf a\nlabel\nargument (to a\nb\n,\nt\n, or\n:\ncommand) contains characters\noutside of the portable filename character set, or if a\nlabel\nis\nlonger than 8 bytes, the behavior is unspecified. The\nimplementation shall support\nlabel\narguments recognized as unique\nup to at least 8 bytes; the actual length (greater than or equal\nto 8) supported by the implementation is unspecified. It is\nunspecified whether exceeding the maximum supported label length\ncauses an error or a silent truncation.\n[\n2addr\n] {\nediting command\nediting command\n...\n}\nExecute a list of\nsed\nediting commands only when the\npattern space is selected. The list of\nsed\nediting\ncommands shall be surrounded by braces. The braces can\nbe preceded or followed by <blank> characters. The\n<right-brace> shall be preceded by a <newline> or\n<semicolon> (before any optional <blank> characters\npreceding the <right-brace>).\nEach command in the list of commands shall be terminated\nby a <newline> character, or by a <semicolon> character\nif permitted when the command is used outside the\nbraces.  The editing commands can be preceded by <blank>\ncharacters, but shall not be followed by <blank>\ncharacters.\n[\n1addr\n]a\\\ntext\nWrite text to standard output as described previously.\n[\n2addr\n]b [\nlabel\n]\nBranch to the\n:\ncommand verb bearing the\nlabel\nargument.\nIf\nlabel\nis not specified, branch to the end of the\nscript.\n[\n2addr\n]c\\\ntext\nDelete the pattern space. With a 0 or 1 address or at\nthe end of a 2-address range, place\ntext\non the output\nand start the next cycle.\n[\n2addr\n]d\nDelete the pattern space and start the next cycle.\n[\n2addr\n]D\nIf the pattern space contains no <newline>, delete the\npattern space and start a normal new cycle as if the\nd\ncommand was issued. Otherwise, delete the initial\nsegment of the pattern space through the first\n<newline>, and start the next cycle with the resultant\npattern space and without reading any new input.\n[\n2addr\n]g\nReplace the contents of the pattern space by the\ncontents of the hold space.\n[\n2addr\n]G\nAppend to the pattern space a <newline> followed by the\ncontents of the hold space.\n[\n2addr\n]h\nReplace the contents of the hold space with the contents\nof the pattern space.\n[\n2addr\n]H\nAppend to the hold space a <newline> followed by the\ncontents of the pattern space.\n[\n1addr\n]i\\\ntext\nWrite\ntext\nto standard output.\n[\n2addr\n]l\n(The letter ell.) Write the pattern space to standard\noutput in a visually unambiguous form. The characters\nlisted in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nTable 5-1\n,\nEscape Sequences and Associated Actions\n(\n'\\\\'\n,\n'\\a'\n,\n'\\b'\n,\n'\\f'\n,\n'\\r'\n,\n'\\t'\n,\n'\\v'\n) shall be\nwritten as the corresponding escape sequence; the\n'\\n'\nin that table is not applicable. Non-printable\ncharacters not in that table shall be written as one\nthree-digit octal number (with a preceding <backslash>)\nfor each byte in the character (most significant byte\nfirst).\nLong lines shall be folded, with the point of folding\nindicated by writing a <backslash> followed by a\n<newline>; the length at which folding occurs is\nunspecified, but should be appropriate for the output\ndevice. The end of each line shall be marked with a\n'$'\n.\n[\n2addr\n]n\nWrite the pattern space to standard output if the\ndefault output has not been suppressed, and replace the\npattern space with the next line of input, less its\nterminating <newline>.\nIf no next line of input is available, the\nn\ncommand\nverb shall branch to the end of the script and quit\nwithout starting a new cycle.\n[\n2addr\n]N\nAppend the next line of input, less its terminating\n<newline>, to the pattern space, using an embedded\n<newline> to separate the appended material from the\noriginal material. Note that the current line number\nchanges.\nIf no next line of input is available, the\nN\ncommand\nverb shall branch to the end of the script and quit\nwithout starting a new cycle or copying the pattern\nspace to standard output.\n[\n2addr\n]p\nWrite the pattern space to standard output.\n[\n2addr\n]P\nWrite the pattern space, up to the first <newline>, to\nstandard output.\n[\n1addr\n]q\nBranch to the end of the script and quit without\nstarting a new cycle.\n[\n1addr\n]r\nrfile\nCopy the contents of\nrfile\nto standard output as\ndescribed previously. If\nrfile\ndoes not exist or cannot\nbe read, it shall be treated as if it were an empty\nfile, causing no error condition.\n[\n2addr\n]s/\nBRE\n/\nreplacement\n/\nflags\nSubstitute the replacement string for instances of the\nBRE in the pattern space. Any character other than\n<backslash> or <newline> can be used instead of a\n<slash> to delimit the BRE and the replacement. Within\nthe BRE and the replacement, the BRE delimiter itself\ncan be used as a literal character if it is preceded by\na <backslash>.\nThe replacement string shall be scanned from beginning\nto end. An <ampersand> (\n'&'\n) appearing in the\nreplacement shall be replaced by the string matching the\nBRE. The special meaning of\n'&'\nin this context can be\nsuppressed by preceding it by a <backslash>.  The\ncharacters \"\\\nn\"\n, where\nn\nis a digit, shall be replaced\nby the text matched by the corresponding back-reference\nexpression. If the corresponding back-reference\nexpression does not match, then the characters \"\\\nn\"\nshall be replaced by the empty string. The special\nmeaning of \"\\\nn\"\nwhere\nn\nis a digit in this context, can\nbe suppressed by preceding it by a <backslash>.  For\neach other <backslash> encountered, the following\ncharacter shall lose its special meaning (if any).\nA line can be split by substituting a <newline> into it.\nThe application shall escape the <newline> in the\nreplacement by preceding it by a <backslash>.\nThe meaning of an unescaped <backslash> immediately\nfollowed by any character other than\n'&'\n, <backslash>, a\ndigit, <newline>, or the delimiter character used for\nthis command, is unspecified.\nA substitution shall be considered to have been\nperformed even if the replacement string is identical to\nthe string that it replaces. Any <backslash> used to\nalter the default meaning of a subsequent character\nshall be discarded from the BRE or the replacement\nbefore evaluating the BRE or using the replacement.\nThe value of\nflags\nshall be zero or more of:\nn\nSubstitute for the\nn\nth occurrence only of the\nBRE found within the pattern space.\ng\nGlobally substitute for all non-overlapping\ninstances of the BRE rather than just the\nfirst one. If both\ng\nand\nn\nare specified, the\nresults are unspecified.\np\nWrite the pattern space to standard output if\na replacement was made.\nw\nwfile\nWrite. Append the pattern space to\nwfile\nif a\nreplacement was made. A conforming application\nshall precede the\nwfile\nargument with one or\nmore <blank> characters. If the\nw\nflag is not\nthe last flag value given in a concatenation\nof multiple flag values, the results are\nundefined.\n[\n2addr\n]t [\nlabel\n]\nTest. Branch to the\n:\ncommand verb bearing the\nlabel\nif\nany substitutions have been made since the most recent\nreading of an input line or execution of a\nt\n.  If\nlabel\nis not specified, branch to the end of the script.\n[\n2addr\n]w\nwfile\nAppend (write) the pattern space to\nwfile\n.\n[\n2addr\n]x\nExchange the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.\n[\n2addr\n]y/\nstring1\n/\nstring2\n/\nReplace all occurrences of characters in\nstring1\nwith\nthe corresponding characters in\nstring2\n.  If a\n<backslash> followed by an\n'n'\nappear in\nstring1\nor\nstring2\n, the two characters shall be handled as a single\n<newline>.  If the number of characters in\nstring1\nand\nstring2\nare not equal, or if any of the characters in\nstring1\nappear more than once, the results are\nundefined. Any character other than <backslash> or\n<newline> can be used instead of <slash> to delimit the\nstrings. If the delimiter is not\n'n'\n, within\nstring1\nand\nstring2\n, the delimiter itself can be used as a literal\ncharacter if it is preceded by a <backslash>.  If a\n<backslash> character is immediately followed by a\n<backslash> character in\nstring1\nor\nstring2\n, the two\n<backslash> characters shall be counted as a single\nliteral <backslash> character. The meaning of a\n<backslash> followed by any character that is not\n'n'\n, a\n<backslash>, or the delimiter character is undefined.\n[\n0addr\n]:\nlabel\nDo nothing.

Also note that\n'\\n'\ncannot be used to match a\n<newline> at the end of an arbitrary input line; <newline>\ncharacters appear in the pattern space as a result of the\nN\nediting command.\nWhen using\nsed\nto process pathnames, it is recommended that\nLC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or C\nin the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences\nthat do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case\nthe utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale\neach byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this\nproblem is avoided.\nEXAMPLES\ntop\nThis\nsed\nscript simulates the BSD\ncat\n-s\ncommand, squeezing excess\nempty lines from standard input.\nsed -n '\n# Write non-empty lines.\n/./ {\np\nd\n}\n# Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.\n/^$/    p\n# Get next line, discard the held <newline> (empty line),\n# and look for more empty lines.\n:Empty\n/^$/    {\nN\ns/.//\nb Empty\n}\n# Write the non-empty line before going back to search\n# for the first in a set of empty lines.\np\n'\nThe following\nsed\ncommand is a much simpler method of squeezing\nempty lines, although it is not quite the same as\ncat\n-s\nsince it\nremoves any initial empty lines:\nsed -n '/./,/^$/p'\nRATIONALE\ntop\nThis volume of POSIX.1â2017 requires implementations to support at\nleast ten distinct\nwfile\ns, matching historical practice on many\nimplementations. Implementations are encouraged to support more,\nbut conforming applications should not exceed this limit.\nThe exit status codes specified here are different from those in\nSystem V. System V returns 2 for garbled\nsed\ncommands, but returns\nzero with its usage message or if the input file could not be\nopened. The standard developers considered this to be a bug.\nThe manner in which the\nl\ncommand writes non-printable characters\nwas changed to avoid the historical backspace-overstrike method,\nand other requirements to achieve unambiguous output were added.\nSee the RATIONALE for\ned(1p)\nfor details of the format chosen,\nwhich is the same as that chosen for\nsed\n.\nThis volume of POSIX.1â2017 requires implementations to provide\npattern and hold spaces of at least 8192 bytes, larger than the\n4000 bytes spaces used by some historical implementations, but\nless than the 20480 bytes limit used in an early proposal.\nImplementations are encouraged to allocate dynamically larger\npattern and hold spaces as needed.\nThe requirements for acceptance of <blank> and <space> characters\nin command lines has been made more explicit than in early\nproposals to describe clearly the historical practice and to\nremove confusion about the phrase ``protect initial blanks [\nsic\n]\nand tabs from the stripping that is done on every script line''\nthat appears in much of the historical documentation of the\nsed\nutility description of text. (Not all implementations are known to\nhave stripped <blank> characters from text lines, although they\nall have allowed leading <blank> characters preceding the address\non a command line.)\nThe treatment of\n'#'\ncomments differs from the SVID which only\nallows a comment as the first line of the script, but matches BSD-\nderived implementations. The comment character is treated as a\ncommand, and it has the same properties in terms of being accepted\nwith leading <blank> characters; the BSD implementation has\nhistorically supported this.\nEarly proposals required that a\nscript_file\nhave at least one non-\ncomment line. Some historical implementations have behaved in\nunexpected ways if this were not the case. The standard developers\nconsidered that this was incorrect behavior and that application\ndevelopers should not have to avoid this feature. A correct\nimplementation of this volume of POSIX.1â2017 shall permit\nscript_file\ns that consist only of comment lines.\nEarly proposals indicated that if\n-e\nand\n-f\noptions were\nintermixed, all\n-e\noptions were processed before any\n-f\noptions.\nThis has been changed to process them in the order presented\nbecause it matches historical practice and is more intuitive.\nThe treatment of the\np\nflag to the\ns\ncommand differs between\nSystem V and BSD-based systems when the default output is\nsuppressed. In the two examples:\necho a | sed    's/a/A/p'\necho a | sed -n 's/a/A/p'\nthis volume of POSIX.1â2017, BSD, System V documentation, and the\nSVID indicate that the first example should write two lines with\nA\n, whereas the second should write one. Some System V systems\nwrite the\nA\nonly once in both examples because the\np\nflag is\nignored if the\n-n\noption is not specified.\nThis is a case of a diametrical difference between systems that\ncould not be reconciled through the compromise of declaring the\nbehavior to be unspecified. The SVID/BSD/System V documentation\nbehavior was adopted for this volume of POSIX.1â2017 because:\n*  No known documentation for any historic system describes the\ninteraction between the\np\nflag and the\n-n\noption.\n*  The selected behavior is more correct as there is no technical\njustification for any interaction between the\np\nflag and the\n-n\noption. A relationship between\n-n\nand the\np\nflag might\nimply that they are only used together, but this ignores valid\nscripts that interrupt the cyclical nature of the processing\nthrough the use of the\nD\n,\nd\n,\nq\n, or branching commands. Such\nscripts rely on the\np\nsuffix to write the pattern space\nbecause they do not make use of the default output at the\n``bottom'' of the script.\n*  Because the\n-n\noption makes the\np\nflag unnecessary, any\ninteraction would only be useful if\nsed\nscripts were written\nto run both with and without the\n-n\noption. This is believed\nto be unlikely. It is even more unlikely that programmers have\ncoded the\np\nflag expecting it to be unnecessary. Because the\ninteraction was not documented, the likelihood of a programmer\ndiscovering the interaction and depending on it is further\ndecreased.\n*  Finally, scripts that break under the specified behavior\nproduce too much output instead of too little, which is easier\nto diagnose and correct.\nThe form of the substitute command that uses the\nn\nsuffix was\nlimited to the first 512 matches in an early proposal. This limit\nhas been removed because there is no reason an editor processing\nlines of {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The\ncommand\ns/a/A/2047\nshould be able to substitute the 2047th\noccurrence of\na\non a line.\nThe\nb\n,\nt\n, and\n:\ncommands are documented to ignore leading white\nspace, but no mention is made of trailing white space. Historical\nimplementations of\nsed\nassigned different locations to the labels\n'x'\nand\n\"x \"\n.  This is not useful, and leads to subtle programming\nerrors, but it is historical practice, and changing it could\ntheoretically break working scripts. Implementors are encouraged\nto provide warning messages about labels that are never referenced\nby a\nb\nor\nt\ncommand, jumps to labels that do not exist, and label\narguments that are subject to truncation.\nEarlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with\nbytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this\nversion.\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\ntop\nNone.\nSEE ALSO\ntop\nawk(1p)\n,\ned(1p)\n,\ngrep(1p)\nThe Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1â2017,\nTable 5-1\n,\nEscape\nSequences and Associated Actions\n,\nChapter 8\n,\nEnvironment\nVariables\n,\nSection 9.3\n,\nBasic Regular Expressions\n,\nSection 12.2\n,\nUtility Syntax Guidelines\nCOPYRIGHT\ntop\nPortions of this text are reprinted and reproduced in electronic\nform from IEEE Std 1003.1-2017, Standard for Information\nTechnology -- Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX), The\nOpen Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 Edition, Copyright\n(C) 2018 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,\nInc and The Open Group.

If this option is used\nmultiple times or is combined with the\n-f\n(\n--file\n) option,\nsearch for all patterns given.  This option can be used to\nprotect a pattern beginning with â-â.\n-f\nFILE\n,\n--file=\nFILE\nObtain patterns from\nFILE\n, one per line.  If this option is\nused multiple times or is combined with the\n-e\n(\n--regexp\n)\noption, search for all patterns given.  The empty file\ncontains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.  If\nFILE\nis\n-\n, read patterns from standard input.\n-i\n,\n--ignore-case\nIgnore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so\nthat characters that differ only in case match each other.\n--no-ignore-case\nDo not ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data.\nThis is the default.  This option is useful for passing to\nshell scripts that already use\n-i\n, to cancel its effects\nbecause the two options override each other.\n-v\n,\n--invert-match\nInvert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.\n-w\n,\n--word-regexp\nSelect only those lines containing matches that form whole\nwords.  The test is that the matching substring must either\nbe at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word\nconstituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the\nend of the line or followed by a non-word constituent\ncharacter.  Word-constituent characters are letters,\ndigits, and the underscore.  This option has no effect if\n-x\nis also specified.\n-x\n,\n--line-regexp\nSelect only those matches that exactly match the whole\nline.  For a regular expression pattern, this is like\nparenthesizing the pattern and then surrounding it with\n^\nand\n$\n.\nGeneral Output Control\n-c\n,\n--count\nSuppress normal output; instead print a count of matching\nlines for each input file.  With the\n-v\n,\n--invert-match\noption (see above), count non-matching lines.\n--color\n[\n=\nWHEN\n],\n--colour\n[\n=\nWHEN\n]\nSurround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines,\ncontext lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and\nseparators (for fields and groups of context lines) with\nescape sequences to display them in color on the terminal.\nThe colors are defined by the environment variable\nGREP_COLORS\n.\nWHEN\nis\nnever\n,\nalways\n, or\nauto\n.\n-L\n,\n--files-without-match\nSuppress normal output; instead print the name of each\ninput file from which no output would normally have been\nprinted.\n-l\n,\n--files-with-matches\nSuppress normal output; instead print the name of each\ninput file from which output would normally have been\nprinted.  Scanning each input file stops upon first match.\n-m\nNUM\n,\n--max-count=\nNUM\nStop reading a file after\nNUM\nmatching lines.  If\nNUM\nis\nzero,\ngrep\nstops right away without reading input.  A\nNUM\nof -1 is treated as infinity and\ngrep\ndoes not stop; this\nis the default.  If the input is standard input from a\nregular file, and\nNUM\nmatching lines are output,\ngrep\nensures that the standard input is positioned to just after\nthe last matching line before exiting, regardless of the\npresence of trailing context lines.  This enables a calling\nprocess to resume a search.  When\ngrep\nstops after\nNUM\nmatching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.\nWhen the\n-c\nor\n--count\noption is also used,\ngrep\ndoes not\noutput a count greater than\nNUM\n.  When the\n-v\nor\n--invert-match\noption is also used,\ngrep\nstops after\noutputting\nNUM\nnon-matching lines.\n-o\n,\n--only-matching\nPrint only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching\nline, with each such part on a separate output line.\n-q\n,\n--quiet\n,\n--silent\nQuiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit\nimmediately with zero status if any match is found, even if\nan error was detected.  Also see the\n-s\nor\n--no-messages\noption.\n-s\n,\n--no-messages\nSuppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable\nfiles.\nOutput Line Prefix Control\n-b\n,\n--byte-offset\nPrint the 0-based byte offset within the input file before\neach line of output.  If\n-o\n(\n--only-matching\n) is specified,\nprint the offset of the matching part itself.\n-H\n,\n--with-filename\nPrint the file name for each match.  This is the default\nwhen there is more than one file to search.  This is a GNU\nextension.\n-h\n,\n--no-filename\nSuppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is\nthe default when there is only one file (or only standard\ninput) to search.\n--label=\nLABEL\nDisplay input actually coming from standard input as input\ncoming from file\nLABEL\n.  This can be useful for commands\nthat transform a file's contents before searching, e.g.,\ngzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H 'some pattern'\n.  See\nalso the\n-H\noption.\n-n\n,\n--line-number\nPrefix each line of output with the 1-based line number\nwithin its input file.\n-T\n,\n--initial-tab\nMake sure that the first character of actual line content\nlies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks\nnormal.  This is useful with options that prefix their\noutput to the actual content:\n-H\n,\n-n\n, and\n-b\n.  In order to\nimprove the probability that lines from a single file will\nall start at the same column, this also causes the line\nnumber and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a\nminimum size field width.\n-Z\n,\n--null\nOutput a zero byte (the ASCII\nNUL\ncharacter) instead of the\ncharacter that normally follows a file name.  For example,\ngrep -lZ\noutputs a zero byte after each file name instead\nof the usual newline.  This option makes the output\nunambiguous, even in the presence of file names containing\nunusual characters like newlines.  This option can be used\nwith commands like\nfind -print0\n,\nperl -0\n,\nsort -z\n, and\nxargs -0\nto process arbitrary file names, even those that\ncontain newline characters.\nContext Line Control\n-A\nNUM\n,\n--after-context=\nNUM\nPrint\nNUM\nlines of trailing context after matching lines.\nPlaces a line containing a group separator (\n--\n) between\ncontiguous groups of matches.  With the\n-o\nor\n--only-matching\noption, this has no effect and a warning is\ngiven.\n-B\nNUM\n,\n--before-context=\nNUM\nPrint\nNUM\nlines of leading context before matching lines.\nPlaces a line containing a group separator (\n--\n) between\ncontiguous groups of matches.  With the\n-o\nor\n--only-matching\noption, this has no effect and a warning is\ngiven.\n-C\nNUM\n,\n-\nNUM\n,\n--context=\nNUM\nPrint\nNUM\nlines of output context.  Places a line\ncontaining a group separator (\n--\n) between contiguous groups\nof matches.  With the\n-o\nor\n--only-matching\noption, this\nhas no effect and a warning is given.\n--group-separator=\nSEP\nWhen\n-A\n,\n-B\n, or\n-C\nare in use, print\nSEP\ninstead of\n--\nbetween groups of lines.\n--no-group-separator\nWhen\n-A\n,\n-B\n, or\n-C\nare in use, do not print a separator\nbetween groups of lines.\nFile and Directory Selection\n-a\n,\n--text\nProcess a binary file as if it were text; this is\nequivalent to the\n--binary-files=text\noption.\n--binary-files=\nTYPE\nIf a file's data or metadata indicate that the file\ncontains binary data, assume that the file is of type\nTYPE\n.\nNon-text bytes indicate binary data; these are either\noutput bytes that are improperly encoded for the current\nlocale, or null input bytes when the\n-z\noption is not\ngiven.\nBy default,\nTYPE\nis\nbinary\n, and\ngrep\nsuppresses output\nafter null input binary data is discovered, and suppresses\noutput lines that contain improperly encoded data.  When\nsome output is suppressed,\ngrep\nfollows any output with a\nmessage to standard error saying that a binary file\nmatches.\nIf\nTYPE\nis\nwithout-match\n, when\ngrep\ndiscovers null input\nbinary data it assumes that the rest of the file does not\nmatch; this is equivalent to the\n-I\noption.\nIf\nTYPE\nis\ntext\n,\ngrep\nprocesses a binary file as if it were\ntext; this is equivalent to the\n-a\noption.\nWhen\ntype\nis\nbinary\n,\ngrep\nmay treat non-text bytes as line\nterminators even without the\n-z\noption.  This means\nchoosing\nbinary\nversus\ntext\ncan affect whether a pattern\nmatches a file.  For example, when\ntype\nis\nbinary\nthe\npattern\nq$ might\nmatch\nq\nimmediately followed by a null\nbyte, even though this is not matched when\ntype\nis\ntext\n.\nConversely, when\ntype\nis\nbinary\nthe pattern\n.\n(period)\nmight not match a null byte.\nWarning:\nThe\n-a\noption might output binary garbage, which\ncan have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and\nif the terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.\nOn the other hand, when reading files whose text encodings\nare unknown, it can be helpful to use\n-a\nor to set\nLC_ALL='C'\nin the environment, in order to find more\nmatches even if the matches are unsafe for direct display.\n-D\nACTION\n,\n--devices=\nACTION\nIf an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use\nACTION\nto\nprocess it.  By default,\nACTION\nis\nread\n, which means that\ndevices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If\nACTION\nis\nskip\n, devices are silently skipped.\n-d\nACTION\n,\n--directories=\nACTION\nIf an input file is a directory, use\nACTION\nto process it.\nBy default,\nACTION\nis\nread\n, i.e., read directories just as\nif they were ordinary files.  If\nACTION\nis\nskip\n, silently\nskip directories.  If\nACTION\nis\nrecurse\n, read all files\nunder each directory, recursively, following symbolic links\nonly if they are on the command line.  This is equivalent\nto the\n-r\noption.\n--exclude=\nGLOB\nSkip any command-line file with a name suffix that matches\nthe pattern\nGLOB\n, using wildcard matching; a name suffix is\neither the whole name, or a trailing part that starts with\na non-slash character immediately after a slash (\n/\n) in the\nname.  When searching recursively, skip any subfile whose\nbase name matches\nGLOB\n; the base name is the part after the\nlast slash.  A pattern can use\n*\n,\n?\n, and\n[\n...\n]\nas\nwildcards, and\n\\\nto quote a wildcard or backslash character\nliterally.\n--exclude-from=\nFILE\nSkip files whose base name matches any of the file-name\nglobs read from\nFILE\n(using wildcard matching as described\nunder\n--exclude\n).\n--exclude-dir=\nGLOB\nSkip any command-line directory with a name suffix that\nmatches the pattern\nGLOB\n.  When searching recursively, skip\nany subdirectory whose base name matches\nGLOB\n.  Ignore any\nredundant trailing slashes in\nGLOB\n.\n-I\nProcess a binary file as if it did not contain matching\ndata; this is equivalent to the\n--binary-files=without-match\noption.\n--include=\nGLOB\nSearch only files whose base name matches\nGLOB\n(using\nwildcard matching as described under\n--exclude\n).  If\ncontradictory\n--include\nand\n--exclude\noptions are given,\nthe last matching one wins.  If no\n--include\nor\n--exclude\noptions match, a file is included unless the first such\noption is\n--include\n.\n-r\n,\n--recursive\nRead all files under each directory, recursively, following\nsymbolic links only if they are on the command line.  Note\nthat if no file operand is given,\ngrep\nsearches the working\ndirectory.  This is equivalent to the\n-d recurse\noption.\n-R\n,\n--dereference-recursive\nRead all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow\nall symbolic links, unlike\n-r\n.\nOther Options\n--line-buffered\nUse line buffering on output.  This can cause a performance\npenalty.\n-U\n,\n--binary\nTreat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and\nMS-Windows,\ngrep\nguesses whether a file is text or binary\nas described for the\n--binary-files\noption.  If\ngrep\ndecides the file is a text file, it strips the CR\ncharacters from the original file contents (to make regular\nexpressions with\n^\nand\n$\nwork correctly).  Specifying\n-U\noverrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and\npassed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a\ntext file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line, this\nwill cause some regular expressions to fail.  This option\nhas no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-\nWindows.\n-z\n,\n--null-data\nTreat input and output data as sequences of lines, each\nterminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead\nof a newline.  Like the\n-Z\nor\n--null\noption, this option\ncan be used with commands like\nsort -z\nto process arbitrary\nfile names.\nREGULAR EXPRESSIONS\ntop\nA regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.\nRegular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic\nexpressions, by using various operators to combine smaller\nexpressions.\ngrep\nunderstands three different versions of regular expression\nsyntax: âbasicâ (BRE), âextendedâ (ERE) and âperlâ (PCRE).  In GNU\ngrep\n, basic and extended regular expressions are merely different\nnotations for the same pattern-matching functionality.  In other\nimplementations, basic regular expressions are ordinarily less\npowerful than extended, though occasionally it is the other way\naround.  The following description applies to extended regular\nexpressions; differences for basic regular expressions are\nsummarized afterwards.  Perl-compatible regular expressions have\ndifferent functionality, and are documented in\npcre2syntax(3)\nand\npcre2pattern(3)\n, but work only if PCRE support is enabled.\nThe fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that\nmatch a single character.  Most characters, including all letters\nand digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any\nmeta-character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it\nwith a backslash.\nThe period\n.\nmatches any single character.  It is unspecified\nwhether it matches an encoding error.\nCharacter Classes and Bracket Expressions\nA\nbracket expression\nis a list of characters enclosed by\n[\nand\n]\n.\nIt matches any single character in that list.  If the first\ncharacter of the list is the caret\n^\nthen it matches any character\nnot\nin the list; it is unspecified whether it matches an encoding\nerror.  For example, the regular expression\n[0123456789]\nmatches\nany single digit.\nWithin a bracket expression, a\nrange expression\nconsists of two\ncharacters separated by a hyphen.  In the default C locale, it\nmatches any single character that appears between the two\ncharacters in ASCII order, inclusive.  For example,\n[a-d]\nis\nequivalent to\n[abcd]\n.  In other locales the behavior is\nunspecified:\n[a-d]\nmight be equivalent to\n[abcd]\nor\n[aBbCcDd]\nor\nsome other bracket expression, or it might fail to match any\ncharacter, or the set of characters that it matches might be\nerratic, or it might be invalid.  To obtain the traditional\ninterpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by\nsetting the\nLC_ALL\nenvironment variable to the value\nC\n.\nFinally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within\nbracket expressions, as follows.  Their names are self\nexplanatory, and they are\n[:alnum:]\n,\n[:alpha:]\n,\n[:blank:]\n,\n[:cntrl:]\n,\n[:digit:]\n,\n[:graph:]\n,\n[:lower:]\n,\n[:print:]\n,\n[:punct:]\n,\n[:space:]\n,\n[:upper:]\n, and\n[:xdigit:]\n.  For example,\n[[:alnum:]]\nmeans the character class of numbers and letters in the current\nlocale.  In the C locale and ASCII character set encoding, this is\nthe same as\n[0-9A-Za-z]\n.  (Note that the brackets in these class\nnames are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in\naddition to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.)  Most\nmeta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket\nexpressions.  To include a literal\n]\nplace it first in the list.\nSimilarly, to include a literal\n^\nplace it anywhere but first.\nFinally, to include a literal\n-\nplace it last.\nAnchoring\nThe caret\n^\nand the dollar sign\n$\nare meta-characters that\nrespectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a\nline.\nThe Backslash Character and Special Expressions\nThe symbols\n\\<\nand\n\\>\nrespectively match the empty string at the\nbeginning and end of a word.  The symbol\n\\b\nmatches the empty\nstring at the edge of a word, and\n\\B\nmatches the empty string\nprovided it's\nnot\nat the edge of a word.  The symbol\n\\w\nis a\nsynonym for\n[_[:alnum:]]\nand\n\\W\nis a synonym for\n[^_[:alnum:]]\n.\nRepetition\nA regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition\noperators:\n?\nThe preceding item is optional and matched at most once.\n*\nThe preceding item will be matched zero or more times.\n+\nThe preceding item will be matched one or more times.\n{\nn\n}\nThe preceding item is matched exactly\nn\ntimes.\n{\nn\n,}\nThe preceding item is matched\nn\nor more times.\n{,\nm\n}\nThe preceding item is matched at most\nm\ntimes.  This is a\nGNU extension.\n{\nn\n,\nm\n}\nThe preceding item is matched at least\nn\ntimes, but not\nmore than\nm\ntimes.\nConcatenation\nTwo regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular\nexpression matches any string formed by concatenating two\nsubstrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions.\nAlternation\nTwo regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator\n|\n; the\nresulting regular expression matches any string matching either\nalternate expression.\nPrecedence\nRepetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn\ntakes precedence over alternation.  A whole expression may be\nenclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules and\nform a subexpression.\nBack-references and Subexpressions\nThe back-reference\n\\\nn\n, where\nn\nis a single digit, matches the\nsubstring previously matched by the\nn\nth parenthesized\nsubexpression of the regular expression.\nBasic vs Extended Regular Expressions\nIn basic regular expressions the meta-characters\n?\n,\n+\n,\n{\n,\n|\n,\n(\n,\nand\n)\nlose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed\nversions\n\\?\n,\n\\+\n,\n\\{\n,\n\\|\n,\n\\(\n, and\n\\)\n.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nNormally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines\nwere selected, and 2 if an error occurred.  However, if the\n-q\nor\n--quiet\nor\n--silent\nis used and a line is selected, the exit\nstatus is 0 even if an error occurred.\nENVIRONMENT\ntop\nThe behavior of\ngrep\nis affected by the following environment\nvariables.\nThe locale for category\nLC_\nfoo\nis specified by examining the three\nenvironment variables\nLC_ALL\n,\nLC_\nfoo\n,\nLANG\n, in that order.  The\nfirst of these variables that is set specifies the locale.  For\nexample, if\nLC_ALL\nis not set, but\nLC_MESSAGES\nis set to\npt_BR\n,\nthen the Brazilian Portuguese locale is used for the\nLC_MESSAGES\ncategory.  The C locale is used if none of these environment\nvariables are set, if the locale catalog is not installed, or if\ngrep\nwas not compiled with national language support (NLS).  The\nshell command\nlocale -a\nlists locales that are currently\navailable.\nGREP_COLORS\nControls how the\n--color\noption highlights output.  Its\nvalue is a colon-separated list of capabilities that\ndefaults to\nms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36\nwith the\nrv\nand\nne\nboolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).\nSupported capabilities are as follows.\nsl=\nSGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e.,\nmatching lines when the\n-v\ncommand-line option is\nomitted, or non-matching lines when\n-v\nis\nspecified).  If however the boolean\nrv\ncapability\nand the\n-v\ncommand-line option are both specified,\nit applies to context matching lines instead.  The\ndefault is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color\npair).\ncx=\nSGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-\nmatching lines when the\n-v\ncommand-line option is\nomitted, or matching lines when\n-v\nis specified).\nIf however the boolean\nrv\ncapability and the\n-v\ncommand-line option are both specified, it applies\nto selected non-matching lines instead.  The default\nis empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).\nrv\nBoolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of\nthe\nsl=\nand\ncx=\ncapabilities when the\n-v\ncommand-\nline option is specified.  The default is false\n(i.e., the capability is omitted).\nmt=01;31\nSGR substring for matching non-empty text in any\nmatching line (i.e., a selected line when the\n-v\ncommand-line option is omitted, or a context line\nwhen\n-v\nis specified).  Setting this is equivalent\nto setting both\nms=\nand\nmc=\nat once to the same\nvalue.  The default is a bold red text foreground\nover the current line background.\nms=01;31\nSGR substring for matching non-empty text in a\nselected line.  (This is only used when the\n-v\ncommand-line option is omitted.)  The effect of the\nsl=\n(or\ncx=\nif\nrv\n) capability remains active when\nthis kicks in.  The default is a bold red text\nforeground over the current line background.\nmc=01;31\nSGR substring for matching non-empty text in a\ncontext line.  (This is only used when the\n-v\ncommand-line option is specified.)  The effect of\nthe\ncx=\n(or\nsl=\nif\nrv\n) capability remains active\nwhen this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text\nforeground over the current line background.\nfn=35\nSGR substring for file names prefixing any content\nline.  The default is a magenta text foreground over\nthe terminal's default background.\nln=32\nSGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content\nline.  The default is a green text foreground over\nthe terminal's default background.\nbn=32\nSGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any content\nline.  The default is a green text foreground over\nthe terminal's default background.\nse=36\nSGR substring for separators that are inserted\nbetween selected line fields (\n:\n), between context\nline fields, (\n-\n), and between groups of adjacent\nlines when nonzero context is specified (\n--\n).  The\ndefault is a cyan text foreground over the\nterminal's default background.\nne\nBoolean value that prevents clearing to the end of\nline using Erase in Line (EL) to Right (\n\\33[K\n) each\ntime a colorized item ends.  This is needed on\nterminals on which EL is not supported.  It is\notherwise useful on terminals for which the\nback_color_erase\n(\nbce\n) boolean terminfo capability\ndoes not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do\nnot affect the background, or when EL is too slow or\ncauses too much flicker.  The default is false\n(i.e., the capability is omitted).\nNote that boolean capabilities have no\n=\n... part.  They are\nomitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when\nspecified.\nSee the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the\ndocumentation of the text terminal that is used for\npermitted values and their meaning as character attributes.\nThese substring values are integers in decimal\nrepresentation and can be concatenated with semicolons.\ngrep\ntakes care of assembling the result into a complete\nSGR sequence (\n\\33[\n...\nm\n).  Common values to concatenate\ninclude\n1\nfor bold,\n4\nfor underline,\n5\nfor blink,\n7\nfor\ninverse,\n39\nfor default foreground color,\n30\nto\n37\nfor\nforeground colors,\n90\nto\n97\nfor 16-color mode foreground\ncolors,\n38;5;0\nto\n38;5;255\nfor 88-color and 256-color modes\nforeground colors,\n49\nfor default background color,\n40\nto\n47\nfor background colors,\n100\nto\n107\nfor 16-color mode\nbackground colors, and\n48;5;0\nto\n48;5;255\nfor 88-color and\n256-color modes background colors.\nLC_ALL\n,\nLC_COLLATE\n,\nLANG\nThese variables specify the locale for the\nLC_COLLATE\ncategory, which determines the collating sequence used to\ninterpret range expressions like\n[a-z]\n.\nLC_ALL\n,\nLC_CTYPE\n,\nLANG\nThese variables specify the locale for the\nLC_CTYPE\ncategory, which determines the type of characters, e.g.,\nwhich characters are whitespace.  This category also\ndetermines the character encoding, that is, whether text is\nencoded in UTF-8, ASCII, or some other encoding.  In the C\nor POSIX locale, all characters are encoded as a single\nbyte and every byte is a valid character.\nLC_ALL\n,\nLC_MESSAGES\n,\nLANG\nThese variables specify the locale for the\nLC_MESSAGES\ncategory, which determines the language that\ngrep\nuses for\nmessages.  The default C locale uses American English\nmessages.\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nIf set,\ngrep\nbehaves as POSIX requires; otherwise,\ngrep\nbehaves more like other GNU programs.  POSIX requires that\noptions that follow file names must be treated as file\nnames; by default, such options are permuted to the front\nof the operand list and are treated as options.  Also,\nPOSIX requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as\nâillegalâ, but since they are not really against the law\nthe default is to diagnose them as âinvalidâ.\nNOTES\ntop\nThis man page is maintained only fitfully; the full documentation\nis often more up-to-date.\nCOPYRIGHT\ntop\nCopyright 1998â2000, 2002, 2005â2025 Free Software Foundation,\nInc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.\nThere is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nBUGS\ntop\nReporting Bugs\nEmail bug reports to the bug-reporting address â¨bug-grep@gnu.orgâ©.\nAn email archive â¨\nhttps://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-grep\nâ©\nand a bug tracker\nâ¨\nhttps://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=grep\nâ© are\navailable.\nKnown Bugs\nLarge repetition counts in the\n{\nn\n,\nm\n}\nconstruct may cause\ngrep\nto\nuse lots of memory.

GNU\nfind\nsearches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by\nevaluating the given expression from left to right, according to\nthe rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome\nis known (the left hand side is false for\nand\noperations, true for\nor\n), at which point\nfind\nmoves on to the next file name.  If no\nstarting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.\nIf you are using\nfind\nin an environment where security is\nimportant (for example if you are using it to search directories\nthat are writable by other users), you should read the `Security\nConsiderations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is\ncalled\nFinding Files\nand comes with findutils.  That document also\nincludes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page,\nso you may find it a more useful source of information.\nOPTIONS\ntop\nThe\n-H\n,\n-L\nand\n-P\noptions control the treatment of symbolic links.\nCommand-line arguments following these are taken to be names of\nfiles or directories to be examined, up to the first argument that\nbegins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and\nany following arguments are taken to be the expression describing\nwhat is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current\ndirectory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression\n-print\nis used (but you should probably consider using\n-print0\ninstead, anyway).\nThis manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.\nThese options control the behaviour of\nfind\nbut are specified\nimmediately after the last path name.  The five `real' options\n-H\n,\n-L\n,\n-P\n,\n-D\nand\n-O\nmust appear before the first path name, if at\nall.  A double dash\n--\ncould theoretically be used to signal that\nany remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really\nwork due to the way\nfind\ndetermines the end of the following path\narguments: it does that by reading until an expression argument\ncomes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument\nwould start with a `-', then\nfind\nwould treat it as expression\nargument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken\nas such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded\nby the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as expression\narguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or dubious\npath names with either `./' or to use absolute path names starting\nwith '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable\nto use the GNU option\n-files0-from\nto pass arbitrary starting\npoints to\nfind\n.\n-P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default\nbehaviour.  When\nfind\nexamines or prints information about\nfiles, and the file is a symbolic link, the information\nused shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic\nlink itself.\n-L     Follow symbolic links.  When\nfind\nexamines or prints\ninformation about files, the information used shall be\ntaken from the properties of the file to which the link\npoints, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken\nsymbolic link or\nfind\nis unable to examine the file to\nwhich the link points).  Use of this option implies\n-noleaf\n.  If you later use the\n-P\noption,\n-noleaf\nwill\nstill be in effect.  If\n-L\nis in effect and\nfind\ndiscovers\na symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the\nsubdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be\nsearched.\nWhen the\n-L\noption is in effect, the\n-type\npredicate will\nalways match against the type of the file that a symbolic\nlink points to rather than the link itself (unless the\nsymbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic\nlinks to become broken while\nfind\nis executing (for example\n-delete\n) can give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using\n-L\ncauses the\n-lname\nand\n-ilname\npredicates always to return\nfalse.\n-H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the\ncommand line arguments.  When\nfind\nexamines or prints\ninformation about files, the information used shall be\ntaken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.  The\nonly exception to this behaviour is when a file specified\non the command line is a symbolic link, and the link can be\nresolved.  For that situation, the information used is\ntaken from whatever the link points to (that is, the link\nis followed).  The information about the link itself is\nused as a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic\nlink cannot be examined.  If\n-H\nis in effect and one of the\npaths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a\ndirectory, the contents of that directory will be examined\n(though of course\n-maxdepth 0\nwould prevent this).\nIf more than one of\n-H\n,\n-L\nand\n-P\nis specified, each overrides the\nothers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.\nSince it is the default, the\n-P\noption should be considered to be\nin effect unless either\n-H\nor\n-L\nis specified.\nGNU\nfind\nfrequently stats files during the processing of the\ncommand line itself, before any searching has begun.  These\noptions also affect how those arguments are processed.\nSpecifically, there are a number of tests that compare files\nlisted on the command line against a file we are currently\nconsidering.  In each case, the file specified on the command line\nwill have been examined and some of its properties will have been\nsaved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the\n-P\noption is in effect (or if neither\n-H\nnor\n-L\nwere specified), the\ninformation used for the comparison will be taken from the\nproperties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from\nthe properties of the file the link points to.  If\nfind\ncannot\nfollow the link (for example because it has insufficient\nprivileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the\nproperties of the link itself will be used.\nWhen the\n-H\nor\n-L\noptions are in effect, any symbolic links listed\nas the argument of\n-newer\nwill be dereferenced, and the timestamp\nwill be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.\nThe same consideration applies to\n-newerXY\n,\n-anewer\nand\n-cnewer\n.\nThe\n-follow\noption has a similar effect to\n-L\n, though it takes\neffect at the point where it appears (that is, if\n-L\nis not used\nbut\n-follow\nis, any symbolic links appearing after\n-follow\non the\ncommand line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).\n-D debugopts\nPrint diagnostic information; this can be helpful to\ndiagnose problems with why\nfind\nis not doing what you want.\nThe list of debug options should be comma separated.\nCompatibility of the debug options is not guaranteed\nbetween releases of findutils.  For a complete list of\nvalid debug options, see the output of\nfind -D help\n.  Valid\ndebug options include\nexec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,\n-execdir, -ok and -okdir\nopt    Prints diagnostic information relating to the\noptimisation of the expression tree; see the -O\noption.\nrates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate\nsucceeded or failed.\nsearch Navigate the directory tree verbosely.\nstat   Print messages as files are examined with the\nstat\nand\nlstat\nsystem calls.  The\nfind\nprogram tries to\nminimise such calls.\ntree   Show the expression tree in its original and\noptimized form.\nall    Enable all of the other debug options (but\nhelp\n).\nhelp   Explain the debugging options.\n-O\nlevel\nEnables query optimisation.  The\nfind\nprogram reorders\ntests to speed up execution while preserving the overall\neffect; that is, predicates with side effects are not\nreordered relative to each other.  The optimisations\nperformed at each optimisation level are as follows.\n0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.\n1      This is the default optimisation level and\ncorresponds to the traditional behaviour.\nExpressions are reordered so that tests based only\non the names of files (for example\n-name\nand\n-regex\n)\nare performed first.\n2      Any\n-type\nor\n-xtype\ntests are performed after any\ntests based only on the names of files, but before\nany tests that require information from the inode.\nOn many modern versions of Unix, file types are\nreturned by\nreaddir()\nand so these predicates are\nfaster to evaluate than predicates which need to\nstat the file first.  If you use the\n-fstype\nFOO\npredicate and specify a filesystem type\nFOO\nwhich is\nnot known (that is, present in `/etc/mtab') at the\ntime\nfind\nstarts, that predicate is equivalent to\n-false\n.\n3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based\nquery optimizer is enabled.  The order of tests is\nmodified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are\nperformed first and more expensive ones are\nperformed later, if necessary.  Within each cost\nband, predicates are evaluated earlier or later\naccording to whether they are likely to succeed or\nnot.  For\n-o\n, predicates which are likely to succeed\nare evaluated earlier, and for\n-a\n, predicates which\nare likely to fail are evaluated earlier.\nThe cost-based optimizer has a fixed idea of how likely any\ngiven test is to succeed.  In some cases the probability\ntakes account of the specific nature of the test (for\nexample,\n-type f\nis assumed to be more likely to succeed\nthan\n-type c\n).  The cost-based optimizer is currently being\nevaluated.  If it does not actually improve the performance\nof\nfind\n, it will be removed again.  Conversely,\noptimisations that prove to be reliable, robust and\neffective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels over\ntime.  However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation\nlevel 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.\nThe findutils test suite runs all the tests on\nfind\nat each\noptimisation level and ensures that the result is the same.\nThe re-ordering of operations performed by the cost-based\noptimizer can result in user-visible behaviour change.  For\nexample, the\n-readable\nand\n-empty\npredicates are sensitive\nto re-ordering.  If they are run in the order\n-empty\n-readable\n, an error message will be issued for unreadable\ndirectories.  If they are run in the order\n-readable -empty\nno error message will be issued.  This is the reason why\nsuch operation re-ordering is not performed at the default\noptimisation level.\nEXPRESSION\ntop\nThe part of the command line after the list of starting points is\nthe\nexpression\n.  This is a kind of query specification describing\nhow we match files and what we do with the files that were\nmatched.  An expression is composed of a sequence of things:\nTests  Tests return a true or false value, usually on the basis of\nsome property of a file we are considering.  The\n-empty\ntest for example is true only when the current file is\nempty.\nActions\nActions have side effects (such as printing something on\nthe standard output) and return either true or false,\nusually based on whether or not they are successful.  The\n-print\naction for example prints the name of the current\nfile on the standard output.\nGlobal options\nGlobal options affect the operation of tests and actions\nspecified on any part of the command line.  Global options\nalways return true.  The\n-depth\noption for example makes\nfind\ntraverse the file system in a depth-first order.\nPositional options\nPositional options affect only tests or actions which\nfollow them.  Positional options always return true.  The\n-regextype\noption for example is positional, specifying the\nregular expression dialect for regular expressions\noccurring later on the command line.\nOperators\nOperators join together the other items within the\nexpression.  They include for example\n-o\n(meaning logical\nOR) and\n-a\n(meaning logical AND).  Where an operator is\nmissing,\n-a\nis assumed.\nThe\n-print\naction is performed on all files for which the whole\nexpression is true, unless it contains an action other than\n-prune\nor\n-quit\n.  Actions which inhibit the default\n-print\nare\n-delete\n,\n-exec\n,\n-execdir\n,\n-fls\n,\n-fprint\n,\n-fprint0\n,\n-fprintf\n,\n-ls\n,\n-ok\n,\n-okdir\n,\n-print0\n,\n-printf\nand\n-print\n.\nThe\n-delete\naction also acts like an option (since it implies\n-depth\n).\nPOSITIONAL OPTIONS\nPositional options always return true.  They affect only tests\noccurring later on the command line.\n-daystart\nMeasure times (for\n-amin\n,\n-atime\n,\n-cmin\n,\n-ctime\n,\n-mmin\n, and\n-mtime\n) from the beginning of today rather than from 24\nhours ago.  This option only affects tests which appear\nlater on the command line.\n-follow\nDeprecated; use the\n-L\noption instead.  Dereference\nsymbolic links.  Implies\n-noleaf\n.  The\n-follow\noption\naffects only those tests which appear after it on the\ncommand line.  Unless the\n-H\nor\n-L\noption has been\nspecified, the position of the\n-follow\noption changes the\nbehaviour of the\n-newer\npredicate; any files listed as the\nargument of\n-newer\nwill be dereferenced if they are\nsymbolic links.  The same consideration applies to\n-newerXY\n,\n-anewer\nand\n-cnewer\n.  Similarly, the\n-type\npredicate will always match against the type of the file\nthat a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.\nUsing\n-follow\ncauses the\n-lname and -ilname\npredicates\nalways to return false.\n-regextype\ntype\nChanges the regular expression syntax understood by\n-regex\nand\n-iregex\ntests which occur later on the command line.\nTo see which regular expression types are known, use\n-regextype help\n.  The Texinfo documentation (see\nSEE ALSO\n)\nexplains the meaning of and differences between the various\ntypes of regular expression.  If you do not use this\noption, find behaves as if the regular expression type\nemacs\nhad been specified.\n-warn, -nowarn\nTurn warning messages on or off.  These warnings apply only\nto the command line usage, not to any conditions that\nfind\nmight encounter when it searches directories.  The default\nbehaviour corresponds to\n-warn\nif standard input is a tty,\nand to\n-nowarn\notherwise.  If a warning message relating to\ncommand-line usage is produced, the exit status of\nfind\nis\nnot affected.  If the\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable\nis set, and\n-warn\nis also used, it is not specified which,\nif any, warnings will be active.\nGLOBAL OPTIONS\nGlobal options always return true.  Global options take effect\neven for tests which occur earlier on the command line.  To\nprevent confusion, global options should be specified on the\ncommand-line after the list of start points, just before the first\ntest, positional option or action.  If you specify a global option\nin some other place,\nfind\nwill issue a warning message explaining\nthat this can be confusing.\nThe global options occur after the list of start points, and so\nare not the same kind of option as\n-L\n, for example.\n-d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD,\nNetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.\n-depth Process each directory's contents before the directory\nitself.  The -delete action also implies\n-depth\n.\n-files0-from\nfile\nRead the starting points from\nfile\ninstead of getting them\non the command line.  In contrast to the known limitations\nof passing starting points via arguments on the command\nline, namely the limitation of the amount of file names,\nand the inherent ambiguity of file names clashing with\noption names, using this option allows to safely pass an\narbitrary number of starting points to\nfind\n.\nUsing this option and passing starting points on the\ncommand line is mutually exclusive, and is therefore not\nallowed at the same time.\nThe\nfile\nargument is mandatory.  One can use\n-files0-from -\nto read the list of starting points from the\nstandard input\nstream, and e.g. from a pipe.  In this case, the actions\n-ok\nand\n-okdir\nare not allowed, because they would\nobviously interfere with reading from\nstandard input\nin\norder to get a user confirmation.\nThe starting points in\nfile\nhave to be separated by ASCII\nNUL characters.  Two consecutive NUL characters, i.e., a\nstarting point with a Zero-length file name is not allowed\nand will lead to an error diagnostic followed by a non-Zero\nexit code later.\nIn the case the given\nfile\nis empty,\nfind\ndoes not process\nany starting point and therefore will exit immediately\nafter parsing the program arguments.  This is unlike the\nstandard invocation where\nfind\nassumes the current\ndirectory as starting point if no path argument is passed.\nThe processing of the starting points is otherwise as\nusual, e.g.\nfind\nwill recurse into subdirectories unless\notherwise prevented.  To process only the starting points,\none can additionally pass\n-maxdepth 0\n.\nFurther notes: if a file is listed more than once in the\ninput file, it is unspecified whether it is visited more\nthan once.  If the\nfile\nis mutated during the operation of\nfind\n, the result is unspecified as well.  Finally, the seek\nposition within the named\nfile\nat the time\nfind\nexits, be\nit with\n-quit\nor in any other way, is also unspecified.  By\n\"unspecified\" here is meant that it may or may not work or\ndo any specific thing, and that the behavior may change\nfrom platform to platform, or from\nfindutils\nrelease to\nrelease.\n-help, --help\nPrint a summary of the command-line usage of\nfind\nand exit.\n-ignore_readdir_race\nNormally,\nfind\nwill emit an error message when it fails to\nstat a file.  If you give this option and a file is deleted\nbetween the time\nfind\nreads the name of the file from the\ndirectory and the time it tries to stat the file, no error\nmessage will be issued.  This also applies to files or\ndirectories whose names are given on the command line.\nThis option takes effect at the time the command line is\nread, which means that you cannot search one part of the\nfilesystem with this option on and part of it with this\noption off (if you need to do that, you will need to issue\ntwo\nfind\ncommands instead, one with the option and one\nwithout it).\nFurthermore,\nfind\nwith the\n-ignore_readdir_race\noption will\nignore errors of the\n-delete\naction in the case the file\nhas disappeared since the parent directory was read: it\nwill not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of\nthe\n-delete\naction will be true.\n-maxdepth\nlevels\nDescend at most\nlevels\n(a non-negative integer) levels of\ndirectories below the starting-points.  Using\n-maxdepth 0\nmeans only apply the tests and actions to the starting-\npoints themselves.\n-mindepth\nlevels\nDo not apply any tests or actions at levels less than\nlevels\n(a non-negative integer).  Using\n-mindepth 1\nmeans\nprocess all files except the starting-points.\n-mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An\nalternate name for\n-xdev\n, for compatibility with some other\nversions of\nfind\n.\n-noignore_readdir_race\nTurns off the effect of\n-ignore_readdir_race\n.\n-noleaf\nDo not optimize by assuming that directories contain 2\nfewer subdirectories than their hard link count.  This\noption is needed when searching filesystems that do not\nfollow the Unix directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM\nor MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points.  Each\ndirectory on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard\nlinks: its name and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its\nsubdirectories (if any) each have a `..' entry linked to\nthat directory.  When\nfind\nis examining a directory, after\nit has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's\nlink count, it knows that the rest of the entries in the\ndirectory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the\ndirectory tree).  If only the files' names need to be\nexamined, there is no need to stat them; this gives a\nsignificant increase in search speed.\n-version, --version\nPrint the\nfind\nversion number and exit.\n-xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.\nTESTS\nSome tests, for example\n-newerXY\nand\n-samefile\n, allow comparison\nbetween the file currently being examined and some reference file\nspecified on the command line.  When these tests are used, the\ninterpretation of the reference file is determined by the options\n-H\n,\n-L\nand\n-P\nand any previous\n-follow\n, but the reference file is\nonly examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If\nthe reference file cannot be examined (for example, the\nstat(2)\nsystem call fails for it), an error message is issued, and\nfind\nexits with a nonzero status.\nA numeric argument\nn\ncan be specified to tests (like\n-amin\n,\n-mtime\n,\n-gid\n,\n-inum\n,\n-links\n,\n-size\n,\n-uid\nand\n-used\n) as\n+n\nfor greater than\nn\n,\n-n\nfor less than\nn\n,\nn\nfor exactly\nn\n.\nSupported tests:\n-amin\nn\nFile was last accessed less than, more than or exactly\nn\nminutes ago.\n-anewer\nreference\nLike\n-newer\n, but test if the time of the last access of the\ncurrent file is more recent than that of the last data\nmodification of the\nreference\nfile.  If\nreference\nis a\nsymbolic link and the\n-H\noption or the\n-L\noption is in\neffect, then the time of the last data modification of the\nfile it points to is always used.\n-atime\nn\nFile was last accessed less than, more than or exactly\nn\n*24\nhours ago.  When\nfind\nfigures out how many 24-hour periods\nago the file was last accessed, any fractional part is\nignored, so to match\n-atime +1\n, a file has to have been\naccessed at least\ntwo\ndays ago.\n-cmin\nn\nFile's status was last changed less than, more than or\nexactly\nn\nminutes ago.\n-cnewer\nreference\nLike\n-newer\n, but test if the time of the last status change\nof the current file is more recent than that of the last\ndata modification of the\nreference\nfile.  If\nreference\nis a\nsymbolic link and the\n-H\noption or the\n-L\noption is in\neffect, then the time of the last data modification of the\nfile it points to is always used.\n-ctime\nn\nFile's status was last changed less than, more than or\nexactly\nn\n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for\n-atime\nto\nunderstand how rounding affects the interpretation of file\nstatus change times.\n-empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.\n-executable\nMatches files which are executable and directories which\nare searchable (in a file name resolution sense) by the\ncurrent user.  This takes into account access control lists\nand other permissions artefacts which the\n-perm\ntest\nignores.  This test makes use of the\naccess(2)\nsystem call,\nand so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping\n(or root-squashing), since many systems implement\naccess(2)\nin the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID\nmapping information held on the server.  Because this test\nis based only on the result of the\naccess(2)\nsystem call,\nthere is no guarantee that a file for which this test\nsucceeds can actually be executed.\n-false Always false.\n-fstype\ntype\nFile is on a filesystem of type\ntype\n.  The valid filesystem\ntypes vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete\nlist of filesystem types that are accepted on some version\nof Unix or another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K,\nS52K.  You can use\n-printf\nwith the %F directive to see the\ntypes of your filesystems.\n-gid\nn\nFile's numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly\nn\n.\n-group\ngname\nFile belongs to group\ngname\n(numeric group ID allowed).\n-ilname\npattern\nLike\n-lname\n, but the match is case insensitive.  If the\n-L\noption or the\n-follow\noption is in effect, this test\nreturns false unless the symbolic link is broken.\n-iname\npattern\nLike\n-name\n, but the match is case insensitive.  For\nexample, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match the file names\n`Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.  The pattern `*foo*` will\nalso match a file called '.foobar'.\n-inum\nn\nFile has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly\nn\n.  It is normally easier to use the\n-samefile\ntest\ninstead.\n-ipath\npattern\nLike\n-path\n.  but the match is case insensitive.\n-iregex\npattern\nLike\n-regex\n, but the match is case insensitive.\n-iwholename\npattern\nSee -ipath.  This alternative is less portable than\n-ipath\n.\n-links\nn\nFile has less than, more than or exactly\nn\nhard links.\n-lname\npattern\nFile is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern\npattern\n.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'\nspecially.  If the\n-L\noption or the\n-follow\noption is in\neffect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is\nbroken.\n-mmin\nn\nFile's data was last modified less than, more than or\nexactly\nn\nminutes ago.\n-mtime\nn\nFile's data was last modified less than, more than or\nexactly\nn\n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for\n-atime\nto\nunderstand how rounding affects the interpretation of file\nmodification times.\n-name\npattern\nBase of file name (the path with the leading directories\nremoved) matches shell pattern\npattern\n.  Because the\nleading directories of the file names are removed, the\npattern\nshould not include a slash, because `-name a/b'\nwill never match anything (and you probably want to use\n-path\ninstead).  An exception to this is when using only a\nslash as\npattern\n(`-name /'), because that is a valid\nstring for matching the root directory \"/\" (because the\nbase name of \"/\" is \"/\").  A warning is issued if you try\nto pass a pattern containing a - but not consisting solely\nof one - slash, unless the environment variable\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis set or the option\n-nowarn\nis used.\nTo ignore a directory and the files under it, use\n-prune\nrather than checking every file in the tree; see an example\nin the description of that action.  Braces are not\nrecognised as being special, despite the fact that some\nshells including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning\nin shell patterns.  The filename matching is performed with\nthe use of the\nfnmatch(3)\nlibrary function.  Don't forget\nto enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it\nfrom expansion by the shell.\n-newer\nreference\nTime of the last data modification of the current file is\nmore recent than that of the last data modification of the\nreference\nfile.  If\nreference\nis a symbolic link and the\n-H\noption or the\n-L\noption is in effect, then the time of the\nlast data modification of the file it points to is always\nused.\n-newerXY\nreference\nSucceeds if timestamp\nX\nof the file being considered is\nnewer than timestamp\nY\nof the file\nreference\n.  The letters\nX\nand\nY\ncan be any of the following letters:\na   The access time of the file\nreference\nB   The birth time of the file\nreference\nc   The inode status change time of\nreference\nm   The modification time of the file\nreference\nt\nreference\nis interpreted directly as a time\nSome combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid\nfor\nX\nto be\nt\n.  Some combinations are not implemented on\nall systems; for example\nB\nis not supported on all systems.\nIf an invalid or unsupported combination of\nXY\nis\nspecified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are\ninterpreted as for the argument to the\n-d\noption of GNU\ndate\n.  If you try to use the birth time of a reference\nfile, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal\nerror message results.  If you specify a test which refers\nto the birth time of files being examined, this test will\nfail for any files where the birth time is unknown.\n-nogroup\nNo group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.\n-nouser\nNo user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.\n-path\npattern\nFile name matches shell pattern\npattern\n.  The\nmetacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for\nexample,\nfind . -path \"./sr*sc\"\nwill print an entry for a directory called\n./src/misc\n(if\none exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree, use\n-prune\nrather than checking every file in the tree.  Note that the\npattern match test applies to the whole file name, starting\nfrom one of the start points named on the command line.  It\nwould only make sense to use an absolute path name here if\nthe relevant start point is also an absolute path.  This\nmeans that this command will never match anything:\nfind bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print\nFind compares the\n-path\nargument with the concatenation of\na directory name and the base name of the file it's\nexamining.  Since the concatenation will never end with a\nslash,\n-path\narguments ending in a slash will match nothing\n(except perhaps a start point specified on the command\nline).  The predicate\n-path\nis also supported by HP-UX\nfind\nand is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.\n-perm\nmode\nFile's permission bits are exactly\nmode\n(octal or\nsymbolic).  Since an exact match is required, if you want\nto use this form for symbolic modes, you may have to\nspecify a rather complex mode string.  For example `-perm\ng=w' will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is,\nones for which group write permission is the only\npermission set).  It is more likely that you will want to\nuse the `/' or `-' forms, for example `-perm -g=w', which\nmatches any file with group write permission.  See the\nEXAMPLES\nsection for some illustrative examples.\n-perm -\nmode\nAll of the permission bits\nmode\nare set for the file.\nSymbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is\nusually the way in which you would want to use them.  You\nmust specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.\nSee the\nEXAMPLES\nsection for some illustrative examples.\n-perm /\nmode\nAny of the permission bits\nmode\nare set for the file.\nSymbolic modes are accepted in this form.  You must specify\n`u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the\nEXAMPLES\nsection for some illustrative examples.  If no\npermission bits in\nmode\nare set, this test matches any file\n(the idea here is to be consistent with the behaviour of\n-perm -000\n).\n-perm +\nmode\nThis is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since\n2005).  Use\n-perm /\nmode\ninstead.\n-readable\nMatches files which are readable by the current user.  This\ntakes into account access control lists and other\npermissions artefacts which the\n-perm\ntest ignores.  This\ntest makes use of the\naccess(2)\nsystem call, and so can be\nfooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-\nsquashing), since many systems implement\naccess(2)\nin the\nclient's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping\ninformation held on the server.\n-regex\npattern\nFile name matches regular expression\npattern\n.  This is a\nmatch on the whole path, not a search.  For example, to\nmatch a file named\n./fubar3\n, you can use the regular\nexpression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'.  The\nregular expressions understood by\nfind\nare by default Emacs\nRegular Expressions, but this can be changed with the\n-regextype\noption.\n-samefile\nname\nFile refers to the same inode as\nname\n.  When\n-L\nis in\neffect, this can include symbolic links.\n-size\nn\n[cwbkMG]\nFile uses less than, more than or exactly\nn\nunits of space,\nrounding up.  The following suffixes can be used:\n`b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no\nsuffix is used)\n`c'    for bytes\n`w'    for two-byte words\n`k'    for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)\n`M'    for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576\nbytes)\n`G'    for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 =\n1073741824 bytes)\nThe size is simply the st_size member of the struct stat\npopulated by the lstat (or stat) system call, rounded up as\nshown above.  In other words, it's consistent with the\nresult you get for\nls -l\n.  Bear in mind that the `%k' and\n`%b' format specifiers of\n-printf\nhandle sparse files\ndifferently.  The `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks\nand never 1024-byte blocks, which is different to the\nbehaviour of\n-ls\n.\nThe + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as\nusual; i.e., an exact size of\nn\nunits does not match.  Bear\nin mind that the size is rounded up to the next unit.\nTherefore\n-size -1M\nis not equivalent to\n-size -1048576c\n.\nThe former only matches empty files, the latter matches\nfiles from 0 to 1,048,575 bytes.\n-true  Always true.\n-type\nc\nFile is of type\nc\n:\nb      block (buffered) special\nc      character (unbuffered) special\nd      directory\np      named pipe (FIFO)\nf      regular file\nl      symbolic link; this is never true if the\n-L\noption\nor the\n-follow\noption is in effect, unless the\nsymbolic link is broken.  If you want to search for\nsymbolic links when\n-L\nis in effect, use\n-xtype\n.\ns      socket\nD      door (Solaris)\nTo search for more than one type at once, you can supply\nthe combined list of type letters separated by a comma `,'\n(GNU extension).\n-uid\nn\nFile's numeric user ID is less than, more than or exactly\nn\n.\n-used\nn\nFile was last accessed less than, more than or exactly\nn\ndays after its status was last changed.\n-user\nuname\nFile is owned by user\nuname\n(numeric user ID allowed).\n-wholename\npattern\nSee -path.  This alternative is less portable than\n-path\n.\n-writable\nMatches files which are writable by the current user.  This\ntakes into account access control lists and other\npermissions artefacts which the\n-perm\ntest ignores.  This\ntest makes use of the\naccess(2)\nsystem call, and so can be\nfooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-\nsquashing), since many systems implement\naccess(2)\nin the\nclient's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping\ninformation held on the server.\n-xtype\nc\nThe same as\n-type\nunless the file is a symbolic link.  For\nsymbolic links: if the\n-H\nor\n-P\noption was specified, true\nif the file is a link to a file of type\nc\n; if the\n-L\noption\nhas been given, true if\nc\nis `l'.  In other words, for\nsymbolic links,\n-xtype\nchecks the type of the file that\n-type\ndoes not check.  If a symbolic link is broken\n(because the thing it points to does not exist or the link\npoints to itself) then\n-xtype\nwill behave the same as\n-type\n.\n-context\npattern\n(SELinux only) Security context of the file matches glob\npattern\n.\nACTIONS\n-delete\nDelete files or directories; true if removal succeeded.  If\nthe removal failed, an error message is issued and\nfind\n's\nexit status will be nonzero (when it eventually exits).\nWarning\n: Don't forget that\nfind\nevaluates the command line\nas an expression, so putting\n-delete\nfirst will make\nfind\ntry to delete everything below the starting points you\nspecified.\nThe use of the\n-delete\naction on the command line\nautomatically turns on the\n-depth\noption.  As in turn\n-depth\nmakes\n-prune\nineffective, the\n-delete\naction cannot\nusefully be combined with\n-prune\n.\nOften, the user might want to test a\nfind\ncommand line with\n-print\nprior to adding\n-delete\nfor the actual removal run.\nTo avoid surprising results, it is usually best to remember\nto use\n-depth\nexplicitly during those earlier test runs.\nThe\n-delete\naction will fail to remove a directory unless\nit is empty.\nTogether with the\n-ignore_readdir_race\noption,\nfind\nwill\nignore errors of the\n-delete\naction in the case the file\nhas disappeared since the parent directory was read: it\nwill not output an error diagnostic, not change the exit\ncode to nonzero, and the return code of the\n-delete\naction\nwill be true.\n-exec\ncommand\n;\nExecute\ncommand\n; true if 0 status is returned.  All\nfollowing arguments to\nfind\nare taken to be arguments to\nthe command until an argument consisting of `;' is\nencountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the current\nfile name being processed everywhere it occurs in the\narguments to the command, not just in arguments where it is\nalone, as in some versions of\nfind\n.  Both of these\nconstructions might need to be escaped (with a `\\') or\nquoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See\nthe\nEXAMPLES\nsection for examples of the use of the\n-exec\noption.  The specified command is run once for each matched\nfile.  The command is executed in the starting directory.\nThere are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of\nthe\n-exec\naction; you should use the\n-execdir\noption\ninstead.\n-exec\ncommand\n{} +\nThis variant of the\n-exec\naction runs the specified command\non the selected files, but the command line is built by\nappending each selected file name at the end; the total\nnumber of invocations of the command will be much less than\nthe number of matched files.  The command line is built in\nmuch the same way that\nxargs\nbuilds its command lines.\nOnly one instance of `{}' is allowed within the command,\nand it must appear at the end, immediately before the `+';\nit needs to be escaped (with a `\\') or quoted to protect it\nfrom interpretation by the shell.  The command is executed\nin the starting directory.  If any invocation with the `+'\nform returns a non-zero value as exit status, then\nfind\nreturns a non-zero exit status.  If\nfind\nencounters an\nerror, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some\npending commands may not be run at all.  For this reason\n-exec\nmy-command\n... {} + -quit\nmay not result in\nmy-\ncommand\nactually being run.  This variant of\n-exec\nalways\nreturns true.\n-execdir\ncommand\n;\n-execdir\ncommand\n{} +\nLike\n-exec\n, but the specified command is run from the\nsubdirectory containing the matched file, which is not\nnormally the directory in which you started\nfind\n.  Each\nselected file name except for the root directory\n\"/\"\nis\nprepended with\n\"./\"\n.  As with -exec, the {} should be\nquoted if find is being invoked from a shell.  This a much\nmore secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids race\nconditions during resolution of the paths to the matched\nfiles.  As with the\n-exec\naction, the `+' form of\n-execdir\nwill build a command line to process more than one matched\nfile, but any given invocation of\ncommand\nwill only list\nfiles that exist in the same subdirectory.  If you use this\noption, you must ensure that your\nPATH\nenvironment variable\ndoes not reference `.'; otherwise, an attacker can run any\ncommands they like by leaving an appropriately-named file\nin a directory in which you will run\n-execdir\n.  The same\napplies to having entries in\nPATH\nwhich are empty or which\nare not absolute directory names.  If any invocation with\nthe `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then\nfind\nreturns a non-zero exit status.  If\nfind\nencounters an\nerror, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some\npending commands may not be run at all.  The result of the\naction depends on whether the\n+\nor the\n;\nvariant is being\nused;\n-execdir\ncommand\n{} +\nalways returns true, while\n-execdir\ncommand\n{} ;\nreturns true only if\ncommand\nreturns\n0.\n-fls\nfile\nTrue; like\n-ls\nbut write to\nfile\nlike\n-fprint\n.  The output\nfile is always created, even if the predicate is never\nmatched.  See the\nUNUSUAL FILENAMES\nsection for information\nabout how unusual characters in filenames are handled.\n-fprint\nfile\nTrue; print the full file name into file\nfile\n.  If\nfile\ndoes not exist when\nfind\nis run, it is created; if it does\nexist, it is truncated.  The file names\n/dev/stdout\nand\n/dev/stderr\nare handled specially; they refer to the\nstandard output and standard error output, respectively.\nThe output file is always created, even if the predicate is\nnever matched.

The block counts are of 1 KiB blocks, unless the\nenvironment variable\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis set, in which case\n512-byte blocks are used.  See the\nUNUSUAL FILENAMES\nsection for information about how unusual characters in\nfilenames are handled.\n-ok\ncommand\n;\nLike\n-exec\nbut ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run\nthe command.  Otherwise just return false.  If the command\nis run, its standard input is redirected from\n/dev/null\n.\nThis action may not be specified together with the\n-files0-from\noption.\nThe response to the prompt is matched against a pair of\nregular expressions to determine if it is an affirmative or\nnegative response.  This regular expression is obtained\nfrom the system if the\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable\nis set, or otherwise from\nfind\n's message translations.  If\nthe system has no suitable definition,\nfind\n's own\ndefinition will be used.  In either case, the\ninterpretation of the regular expression itself will be\naffected by the environment variables\nLC_CTYPE\n(character\nclasses) and\nLC_COLLATE\n(character ranges and equivalence\nclasses).\n-okdir\ncommand\n;\nLike\n-execdir\nbut ask the user first in the same way as for\n-ok\n.  If the user does not agree, just return false.  If\nthe command is run, its standard input is redirected from\n/dev/null\n.  This action may not be specified together with\nthe\n-files0-from\noption.\n-print True; print the full file name on the standard output,\nfollowed by a newline.  If you are piping the output of\nfind\ninto another program and there is the faintest\npossibility that the files which you are searching for\nmight contain a newline, then you should seriously consider\nusing the\n-print0\noption instead of\n-print\n.  See the\nUNUSUAL FILENAMES\nsection for information about how unusual\ncharacters in filenames are handled.\n-print0\nTrue; print the full file name on the standard output,\nfollowed by a null character (instead of the newline\ncharacter that\n-print\nuses).  This allows file names that\ncontain newlines or other types of white space to be\ncorrectly interpreted by programs that process the\nfind\noutput.  This option corresponds to the\n-0\noption of\nxargs\n.\n-printf\nformat\nTrue; print\nformat\non the standard output, interpreting `\\'\nescapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and precisions\ncan be specified as with the\nprintf(3)\nC function.  Please\nnote that many of the fields are printed as %s rather than\n%d, and this may mean that flags don't work as you might\nexpect.  This also means that the `-' flag does work (it\nforces fields to be left-aligned).  Unlike\n-print\n,\n-printf\ndoes not add a newline at the end of the string.  The\nescapes and directives are:\n\\a     Alarm bell.\n\\b     Backspace.\n\\c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush\nthe output.\n\\f     Form feed.\n\\n     Newline.\n\\r     Carriage return.\n\\t     Horizontal tab.\n\\v     Vertical tab.\n\\0     ASCII NUL.\n\\\\     A literal backslash (`\\').\n\\NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).\nA `\\' character followed by any other character is treated\nas an ordinary character, so they both are printed.\n%%     A literal percent sign.\n%a     File's last access time in the format returned by\nthe C\nctime(3)\nfunction.\n%A\nk\nFile's last access time in the format specified by\nk\n, which is either `@' or a directive for the C\nstrftime(3)\nfunction.

If the file name\ncontains no slashes (since it is in the current\ndirectory) the %h specifier expands to `.'.  For\nfiles which are themselves directories and contain a\nslash (including\n/\n), %h expands to the empty string.\nSee the\nEXAMPLES\nsection for an example.\n%H     Starting-point under which file was found.\n%i     File's inode number (in decimal).\n%k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1 KiB\nblocks.  Since disk space is allocated in multiples\nof the filesystem block size this is usually greater\nthan %s/1024, but it can also be smaller if the file\nis a sparse file.\n%l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not\na symbolic link).\n%m     File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses\nthe `traditional' numbers which most Unix\nimplementations use, but if your particular\nimplementation uses an unusual ordering of octal\npermissions bits, you will see a difference between\nthe actual value of the file's mode and the output\nof %m.  Normally you will want to have a leading\nzero on this number, and to do this, you should use\nthe\n#\nflag (as in, for example, `%#m').\n%M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for\nls\n).\nThis directive is supported in findutils 4.2.5 and\nlater.\n%n     Number of hard links to file.\n%p     File's name.\n%P     File's name with the name of the starting-point\nunder which it was found removed.\n%s     File's size in bytes.\n%S     File's sparseness.  This is calculated as\n(BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value\nyou will get for an ordinary file of a certain\nlength is system-dependent.  However, normally\nsparse files will have values less than 1.0, and\nfiles which use indirect blocks may have a value\nwhich is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of\nblocks used by a file is file system dependent.  The\nvalue used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is\nusually 512 bytes.  If the file size is zero, the\nvalue printed is undefined.  On systems which lack\nsupport for st_blocks, a file's sparseness is\nassumed to be 1.0.\n%t     File's last modification time in the format returned\nby the C\nctime(3)\nfunction.\n%T\nk\nFile's last modification time in the format\nspecified by\nk\n, which is the same as for %A.\n%u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has\nno name.\n%U     File's numeric user ID.\n%y     File's type (like in\nls -l\n), U=unknown type\n(shouldn't happen)\n%Y     File's type (like %y), plus follow symbolic links:\n`L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?' for any other error\nwhen determining the type of the target of a\nsymbolic link.\n%Z     (SELinux only) file's security context.\n%{ %[ %(\nReserved for future use.\nA `%' character followed by any other character is\ndiscarded, but the other character is printed (don't rely\non this, as further format characters may be introduced).\nA `%' at the end of the format argument causes undefined\nbehaviour since there is no following character.  In some\nlocales, it may hide your door keys, while in others it may\nremove the final page from the novel you are reading.\nThe %m and %d directives support the\n#\n,\n0\nand\n+\nflags, but\nthe other directives do not, even if they print numbers.\nNumeric directives that do not support these flags include\nG\n,\nU\n,\nb\n,\nD\n,\nk\nand\nn\n.  The `-' format flag is supported and\nchanges the alignment of a field from right-justified\n(which is the default) to left-justified.\nSee the\nUNUSUAL FILENAMES\nsection for information about how\nunusual characters in filenames are handled.\n-prune True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.\nIf\n-depth\nis given, then\n-prune\nhas no effect.  Because\n-delete\nimplies\n-depth\n, you cannot usefully use\n-prune\nand\n-delete\ntogether.  For example, to skip the directory\nsrc/emacs\nand all files and directories under it, and print\nthe names of the other files found, do something like this:\nfind . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print\n-quit  Exit immediately (with return value zero if no errors have\noccurred).  This is different to\n-prune\nbecause\n-prune\nonly\napplies to the contents of pruned directories, while\n-quit\nsimply makes\nfind\nstop immediately.  No child processes\nwill be left running.  Any command lines which have been\nbuilt by\n-exec ... +\nor\n-execdir ... +\nare invoked before\nthe program is exited.  After\n-quit\nis executed, no more\nfiles specified on the command line will be processed.  For\nexample, `\nfind\n/tmp/foo /tmp/bar\n-print -quit\n` will print\nonly `/tmp/foo`.\nOne common use of\n-quit\nis to stop searching the file\nsystem once we have found what we want.  For example, if we\nwant to find just a single file we can do this:\nfind / -name needle -print -quit\nOPERATORS\nListed in order of decreasing precedence:\n(\nexpr\n)\nForce precedence.  Since parentheses are special to the\nshell, you will normally need to quote them.  Many of the\nexamples in this manual page use backslashes for this\npurpose: `\\(...\\)' instead of `(...)'.\n!\nexpr\nTrue if\nexpr\nis false.  This character will also usually\nneed protection from interpretation by the shell.\n-not\nexpr\nSame as !\nexpr\n, but not POSIX compliant.\nexpr1 expr2\nTwo expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an\nimplied\n-a\n;\nexpr2\nis not evaluated if\nexpr1\nis false.\nexpr1\n-a\nexpr2\nSame as\nexpr1 expr2\n.\nexpr1\n-and\nexpr2\nSame as\nexpr1 expr2\n, but not POSIX compliant.\nexpr1\n-o\nexpr2\nOr;\nexpr2\nis not evaluated if\nexpr1\nis true.\nexpr1\n-or\nexpr2\nSame as\nexpr1\n-o\nexpr2\n, but not POSIX compliant.\nexpr1\n,\nexpr2\nList; both\nexpr1\nand\nexpr2\nare always evaluated.  The value\nof\nexpr1\nis discarded; the value of the list is the value\nof\nexpr2\n.  The comma operator can be useful for searching\nfor several different types of thing, but traversing the\nfilesystem hierarchy only once.  The\n-fprintf\naction can be\nused to list the various matched items into several\ndifferent output files.\nPlease note that\n-a\nwhen specified implicitly (for example by two\ntests appearing without an explicit operator between them) or\nexplicitly has higher precedence than\n-o\n.  This means that\nfind .\n-name afile -o -name bfile -print\nwill never print\nafile\n.\nUNUSUAL FILENAMES\ntop\nMany of the actions of\nfind\nresult in the printing of data which\nis under the control of other users.  This includes file names,\nsizes, modification times and so forth.  File names are a\npotential problem since they can contain any character except `\\0'\nand `/'.  Unusual characters in file names can do unexpected and\noften undesirable things to your terminal (for example, changing\nthe settings of your function keys on some terminals).  Unusual\ncharacters are handled differently by various actions, as\ndescribed below.\n-print0, -fprint0\nAlways print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the\noutput is going to a terminal.\n-ls, -fls\nUnusual characters are always escaped.  White space,\nbackslash, and double quote characters are printed using C-\nstyle escaping (for example `\\f', `\\\"').  Other unusual\ncharacters are printed using an octal escape.  Other\nprintable characters (for\n-ls\nand\n-fls\nthese are the\ncharacters between octal 041 and 0176) are printed as-is.\n-printf, -fprintf\nIf the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-\nis.  Otherwise, the result depends on which directive is in\nuse.  The directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand\nto values which are not under control of files' owners, and\nso are printed as-is.  The directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i,\n%k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have values which are\nunder the control of files' owners but which cannot be used\nto send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are\nprinted as-is.  The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are\nquoted.  This quoting is performed in the same way as for\nGNU\nls\n.  This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one\nused for\n-ls\nand\n-fls\n.  If you are able to decide what\nformat to use for the output of\nfind\nthen it is normally\nbetter to use `\\0' as a terminator than to use newline, as\nfile names can contain white space and newline characters.\nThe setting of the\nLC_CTYPE\nenvironment variable is used to\ndetermine which characters need to be quoted.\n-print, -fprint\nQuoting is handled in the same way as for\n-printf\nand\n-fprintf\n.  If you are using\nfind\nin a script or in a\nsituation where the matched files might have arbitrary\nnames, you should consider using\n-print0\ninstead of\n-print\n.\nThe\n-ok\nand\n-okdir\nactions print the current filename as-is.  This\nmay change in a future release.\nSTANDARDS CONFORMANCE\ntop\nFor closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable.  The following options are\nspecified in the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016\nEdition):\n-H\nThis option is supported.\n-L\nThis option is supported.\n-name\nThis option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on\nthe POSIX conformance of the system's\nfnmatch(3)\nlibrary\nfunction.  As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters\n(`*', `?' or `[]' for example) match a leading `.', because\nIEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.  This is a\nchange from previous versions of findutils.\n-type\nSupported.  POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f'\nand `s'.  GNU find also supports `D', representing a Door,\nwhere the OS provides these.  Furthermore, GNU find allows\nmultiple types to be specified at once in a comma-separated\nlist.\n-ok\nSupported.  Interpretation of the response is according to\nthe `yes' and `no' patterns selected by setting the\nLC_MESSAGES\nenvironment variable.  When the\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable is set, these patterns are taken\nsystem's definition of a positive (yes) or negative (no)\nresponse.  See the system's documentation for\nnl_langinfo(3)\n, in particular YESEXPR and NOEXPR.  When\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis not set, the patterns are instead taken\nfrom\nfind\n's own message catalogue.\n-newer\nSupported.  If the file specified is a symbolic link, it is\nalways dereferenced.  This is a change from previous\nbehaviour, which used to take the relevant time from the\nsymbolic link; see the HISTORY section below.\n-perm\nSupported.  If the\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable is\nnot set, some mode arguments (for example +a+x) which are\nnot valid in POSIX are supported for backward-\ncompatibility.\nOther primaries\nThe primaries\n-atime\n,\n-ctime\n,\n-depth\n,\n-exec\n,\n-group\n,\n-links\n,\n-mtime\n,\n-nogroup\n,\n-nouser\n,\n-ok\n,\n-path\n,\n-print\n,\n-prune\n,\n-size\n,\n-user\nand\n-xdev\nare all supported.\nThe POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!'\nand the logical AND/OR operators\n-a\nand\n-o\n.\nAll other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are\nextensions beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of these extensions\nare not unique to GNU find, however.\nThe POSIX standard requires that\nfind\ndetects loops:\nThe\nfind\nutility shall detect infinite loops; that is,\nentering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor\nof the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite\nloop,\nfind\nshall write a diagnostic message to standard\nerror and shall either recover its position in the\nhierarchy or terminate.\nGNU\nfind\ncomplies with these requirements.  The link count of\ndirectories which contain entries which are hard links to an\nancestor will often be lower than they otherwise should be.  This\ncan mean that GNU find will sometimes optimize away the visiting\nof a subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.  Since\nfind\ndoes not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to\navoid emitting a diagnostic message.  Although this behaviour may\nbe somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually\ndepends on this behaviour.  If the leaf optimisation has been\nturned off with\n-noleaf\n, the directory entry will always be\nexamined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is\nappropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used to create filesystem\ncycles as such, but if the\n-L\noption or the\n-follow\noption is in\nuse, a diagnostic message is issued when\nfind\nencounters a loop of\nsymbolic links.  As with loops containing hard links, the leaf\noptimisation will often mean that\nfind\nknows that it doesn't need\nto call\nstat()\nor\nchdir()\non the symbolic link, so this diagnostic\nis frequently not necessary.\nThe\n-d\noption is supported for compatibility with various BSD\nsystems, but you should use the POSIX-compliant option\n-depth\ninstead.\nThe\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable does not affect the\nbehaviour of the\n-regex\nor\n-iregex\ntests because those tests\naren't specified in the POSIX standard.\nENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\ntop\nLANG   Provides a default value for the internationalization\nvariables that are unset or null.\nLC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of\nall the other internationalization variables.\nLC_COLLATE\nThe POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the\npattern matching to be used for the\n-name\noption.  GNU find\nuses the\nfnmatch(3)\nlibrary function, and so support for\nLC_COLLATE\ndepends on the system library.  This variable\nalso affects the interpretation of the response to\n-ok\n;\nwhile the\nLC_MESSAGES\nvariable selects the actual pattern\nused to interpret the response to\n-ok\n, the interpretation\nof any bracket expressions in the pattern will be affected\nby\nLC_COLLATE\n.\nLC_CTYPE\nThis variable affects the treatment of character classes\nused in regular expressions and also with the\n-name\ntest,\nif the system's\nfnmatch(3)\nlibrary function supports this.\nThis variable also affects the interpretation of any\ncharacter classes in the regular expressions used to\ninterpret the response to the prompt issued by\n-ok\n.  The\nLC_CTYPE\nenvironment variable will also affect which\ncharacters are considered to be unprintable when filenames\nare printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.\nLC_MESSAGES\nDetermines the locale to be used for internationalised\nmessages.  If the\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nenvironment variable is\nset, this also determines the interpretation of the\nresponse to the prompt made by the\n-ok\naction.\nNLSPATH\nDetermines the location of the internationalisation message\ncatalogues.\nPATH   Affects the directories which are searched to find the\nexecutables invoked by\n-exec\n,\n-execdir\n,\n-ok\nand\n-okdir\n.\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nDetermines the block size used by\n-ls\nand\n-fls\n.  If\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis set, blocks are units of 512 bytes.\nOtherwise they are units of 1024 bytes.\nSetting this variable also turns off warning messages (that\nis, implies\n-nowarn\n) by default, because POSIX requires\nthat apart from the output for\n-ok\n, all messages printed on\nstderr are diagnostics and must result in a non-zero exit\nstatus.\nWhen\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis not set,\n-perm\n+zzz\nis treated just\nlike\n-perm\n/zzz\nif\n+zzz\nis not a valid symbolic mode.  When\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis set, such constructs are treated as an\nerror.\nWhen\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT\nis set, the response to the prompt\nmade by the\n-ok\naction is interpreted according to the\nsystem's message catalogue, as opposed to according to\nfind\n's own message translations.\nTZ     Affects the time zone used for some of the time-related\nformat directives of\n-printf\nand\n-fprintf\n.\nEXAMPLES\ntop\nSimple `find|xargs` approach\nâ¢   Find files named\ncore\nin or below the directory\n/tmp\nand\ndelete them.\n$ find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f\nNote that this will work incorrectly if there are any\nfilenames containing newlines, single or double quotes, or\nspaces.\nSafer `find -print0 | xargs -0` approach\nâ¢   Find files named\ncore\nin or below the directory\n/tmp\nand\ndelete them, processing filenames in such a way that file or\ndirectory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or\nnewlines are correctly handled.\n$ find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f\nThe\n-name\ntest comes before the\n-type\ntest in order to avoid\nhaving to call\nstat(2)\non every file.\nNote that there is still a race between the time\nfind\ntraverses\nthe hierarchy printing the matching filenames, and the time the\nprocess executed by\nxargs\nworks with that file.\nProcessing arbitrary starting points\nâ¢   Given that another program\nproggy\npre-filters and creates a\nhuge NUL-separated list of files, process those as starting\npoints, and find all regular, empty files among them:\n$ proggy | find -files0-from - -maxdepth 0 -type f -empty\nThe use of\n`-files0-from -`\nmeans to read the names of the\nstarting points from\nstandard input\n, i.e., from the pipe; and\n-maxdepth 0\nensures that only explicitly those entries are\nexamined without recursing into directories (in the case one\nof the starting points is one).\nExecuting a command for each file\nâ¢   Run\nfile\non every file in or below the current directory.\n$ find . -type f -exec file '{}' \\;\nNotice that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to\nprotect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation.\nThe semicolon is similarly protected by the use of a\nbackslash, though single quotes could have been used in that\ncase also.\nIn many cases, one might prefer the\n`-exec ... +`\nor better the\n`-execdir ... +`\nsyntax for performance and security reasons.\nTraversing the filesystem just once â for 2 different actions\nâ¢   Traverse the filesystem just once, listing set-user-ID files\nand directories into\n/root/suid.txt\nand large files into\n/root/big.txt\n.\n$ find / \\\n\\( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt '%#m %u %p\\n' \\) , \\\n\\( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt '%-10s %p\\n' \\)\nThis example uses the line-continuation character '\\' on the\nfirst two lines to instruct the shell to continue reading the\ncommand on the next line.\nSearching files by age\nâ¢   Search for files in your home directory which have been\nmodified in the last twenty-four hours.\n$ find $HOME -mtime 0\nThis command works this way because the time since each file\nwas last modified is divided by 24 hours and any remainder is\ndiscarded.  That means that to match\n-mtime 0\n, a file will\nhave to have a modification in the past which is less than 24\nhours ago.\nSearching files by permissions\nâ¢   Search for files which are executable but not readable.\n$ find /sbin /usr/sbin -executable \\! -readable -print\nâ¢   Search for files which have read and write permission for\ntheir owner, and group, but which other users can read but not\nwrite to.\n$ find . -perm 664\nFiles which meet these criteria but have other permissions\nbits set (for example if someone can execute the file) will\nnot be matched.\nâ¢   Search for files which have read and write permission for\ntheir owner and group, and which other users can read, without\nregard to the presence of any extra permission bits (for\nexample the executable bit).\n$ find . -perm -664\nThis will match a file which has mode\n0777\n, for example.\nâ¢   Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner,\nor their group, or anybody else).\n$ find . -perm /222\nâ¢   Search for files which are writable by either their owner or\ntheir group.\n$ find . -perm /220\n$ find . -perm /u+w,g+w\n$ find . -perm /u=w,g=w\nAll three of these commands do the same thing, but the first\none uses the octal representation of the file mode, and the\nother two use the symbolic form.  The files don't have to be\nwritable by both the owner and group to be matched; either\nwill do.\nâ¢   Search for files which are writable by both their owner and\ntheir group.\n$ find . -perm -220\n$ find . -perm -g+w,u+w\nBoth these commands do the same thing.\nâ¢   A more elaborate search on permissions.\n$ find . -perm -444 -perm /222 \\! -perm /111\n$ find . -perm -a+r -perm /a+w \\! -perm /a+x\nThese two commands both search for files that are readable for\neverybody (\n-perm -444\nor\n-perm -a+r\n), have at least one write\nbit set (\n-perm /222\nor\n-perm /a+w\n) but are not executable for\nanybody (\n! -perm /111\nor\n! -perm /a+x\nrespectively).\nPruning â omitting files and subdirectories\nâ¢   Copy the contents of\n/source-dir\nto\n/dest-dir\n, but omit files\nand directories named\n.snapshot\n(and anything in them).  It\nalso omits files or directories whose name ends in `~', but\nnot their contents.\n$ cd /source-dir\n$ find . -name .snapshot -prune -o \\( \\! -name '*~' -print0 \\) \\\n| cpio -pmd0 /dest-dir\nThe construct\n-prune -o \\( ... -print0 \\)\nis quite common.\nThe idea here is that the expression before\n-prune\nmatches\nthings which are to be pruned.  However, the\n-prune\naction\nitself returns true, so the following\n-o\nensures that the\nright hand side is evaluated only for those directories which\ndidn't get pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are\nnot even visited, so their contents are irrelevant).  The\nexpression on the right hand side of the\n-o\nis in parentheses\nonly for clarity.  It emphasises that the\n-print0\naction takes\nplace only for things that didn't have\n-prune\napplied to them.\nBecause the default `and' condition between tests binds more\ntightly than\n-o\n, this is the default anyway, but the\nparentheses help to show what is going on.\nâ¢   Given the following directory of projects and their associated\nSCM administrative directories, perform an efficient search\nfor the projects' roots:\n$ find repo/ \\\n\\( -exec test -d '{}/.svn' \\; \\\n-or -exec test -d '{}/.git' \\; \\\n-or -exec test -d '{}/CVS' \\; \\\n\\) -print -prune\nSample directories:\nrepo/project1/CVS\nrepo/gnu/project2/.svn\nrepo/gnu/project3/.svn\nrepo/gnu/project3/src/.svn\nrepo/project4/.git\nOutput:\nrepo/project1\nrepo/gnu/project2\nrepo/gnu/project3\nrepo/project4\nIn this example,\n-prune\nprevents unnecessary descent into\ndirectories that have already been discovered (here we do not\nsearch\nproject3/src\nbecause we already found\nproject3/.svn\n),\nbut ensures sibling directories (\nproject2\nand\nproject3\n) are\nfound.\nOther useful examples\nâ¢   Search for several file types.\n$ find /tmp -type f,d,l\nSearch for files, directories, and symbolic links in the\ndirectory\n/tmp\npassing these types as a comma-separated list\n(GNU extension), which is otherwise equivalent to the longer,\nyet more portable:\n$ find /tmp \\( -type f -o -type d -o -type l \\)\nâ¢   Search for files with the particular name\nneedle\nand stop\nimmediately when we find the first one.\n$ find / -name needle -print -quit\nâ¢   Demonstrate the interpretation of the\n%f\nand\n%h\nformat\ndirectives of the\n-printf\naction for some corner-cases.  Here\nis an example including some output.\n$ find . .. / /tmp /tmp/TRACE compile compile/64/tests/find \\\n-maxdepth 0 -printf '[%h][%f]\\n'\n[.][.]\n[.][..]\n[][/]\n[][tmp]\n[/tmp][TRACE]\n[.][compile]\n[compile/64/tests][find]\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nfind\nexits with status 0 if all files are processed successfully,\ngreater than 0 if errors occur.  This is deliberately a very broad\ndescription, but if the return value is non-zero, you should not\nrely on the correctness of the results of\nfind\n.\nWhen some error occurs,\nfind\nmay stop immediately, without\ncompleting all the actions specified.  For example, some starting\npoints may not have been examined or some pending program\ninvocations for\n-exec ... {} +\nor\n-execdir ... {} +\nmay not have\nbeen performed.\nHISTORY\ntop\nA\nfind\nprogram appeared in Version 5 Unix as part of the\nProgrammer's Workbench project and was written by Dick Haight.\nDoug McIlroy's\nA Research UNIX Reader: Annotated Excerpts from the\nProgrammerâs Manual, 1971â1986\nprovides some additional details;\nyou can read it on-line at\n<\nhttps://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf\n>.\nGNU\nfind\nwas originally written by Eric Decker, with enhancements\nby David MacKenzie, Jay Plett, and Tim Wood.  The idea for\nfind\n-print0\nand\nxargs -0\ncame from Dan Bernstein.\nCOMPATIBILITY\ntop\nAs of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for\nexample) used in filename patterns match a leading `.', because\nIEEE POSIX interpretation 126 requires this.\nAs of findutils-4.3.3,\n-perm /000\nnow matches all files instead of\nnone.\nNanosecond-resolution timestamps were implemented in\nfindutils-4.3.3.\nAs of findutils-4.3.11, the\n-delete\naction sets\nfind\n's exit status\nto a nonzero value when it fails.  However,\nfind\nwill not exit\nimmediately.  Previously,\nfind\n's exit status was unaffected by the\nfailure of\n-delete\n.\nFeature                Added in   Also occurs in\n-files0-from           4.9.0\n-newerXY               4.3.3      BSD\n-D                     4.3.1\n-O                     4.3.1\n-readable              4.3.0\n-writable              4.3.0\n-executable            4.3.0\n-regextype             4.2.24\n-exec ... +            4.2.12     POSIX\n-execdir               4.2.12     BSD\n-okdir                 4.2.12\n-samefile              4.2.11\n-H                     4.2.5      POSIX\n-L                     4.2.5      POSIX\n-P                     4.2.5      BSD\n-delete                4.2.3\n-quit                  4.2.3\n-d                     4.2.3      BSD\n-wholename             4.2.0\n-iwholename            4.2.0\n-ignore_readdir_race   4.2.0\n-fls                   4.0\n-ilname                3.8\n-iname                 3.8\n-ipath                 3.8\n-iregex                3.8\n-print0                2.0        POSIX (from Issue 8)\nThe syntax\n-perm +MODE\nwas removed in findutils-4.5.12, in favour\nof\n-perm /MODE\n.  The\n+MODE\nsyntax had been deprecated since\nfindutils-4.2.21 which was released in 2005.\nNON-BUGS\ntop\nOperator precedence surprises\nThe command\nfind . -name afile -o -name bfile -print\nwill never\nprint\nafile\nbecause this is actually equivalent to\nfind . -name\nafile -o \\( -name bfile -a -print \\)\n.  Remember that the\nprecedence of\n-a\nis higher than that of\n-o\nand when there is no\noperator specified between tests,\n-a\nis assumed.\nâpaths must precede expressionâ error message\n$ find . -name *.c -print\nfind: paths must precede expression\nfind: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?\nThis happens when the shell could expand the pattern\n*.c\nto more\nthan one file name existing in the current directory, and passing\nthe resulting file names in the command line to\nfind\nlike this:\nfind . -name frcode.c locate.c word_io.c -print\nThat command is of course not going to work, because the\n-name\npredicate allows exactly only one pattern as argument.  Instead of\ndoing things this way, you should enclose the pattern in quotes or\nescape the wildcard, thus allowing\nfind\nto use the pattern with\nthe wildcard during the search for file name matching instead of\nfile names expanded by the parent shell:\n$ find . -name '*.c' -print\n$ find . -name \\*.c -print\nBUGS\ntop\nThere are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the\nPOSIX standard specifies for\nfind\n, which therefore cannot be\nfixed.  For example, the\n-exec\naction is inherently insecure, and\n-execdir\nshould be used instead.\nThe environment variable\nLC_COLLATE\nhas no effect on the\n-ok\naction.\nREPORTING BUGS\ntop\nGNU findutils online help:\n<\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/#get-help\n>\nReport any translation bugs to\n<\nhttps://translationproject.org/team/\n>\nReport any other issue via the form at the GNU Savannah bug\ntracker:\n<\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils\n>\nGeneral topics about the GNU findutils package are discussed at\nthe\nbug-findutils\nmailing list:\n<\nhttps://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-findutils\n>\nCOPYRIGHT\ntop\nCopyright Â© 1990â2025 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.\nThe command line for\ncommand\nis built up until it reaches a sysâ\ntem-defined limit (unless the\n-n\nand\n-L\noptions are used).  The\nspecified\ncommand\nwill be invoked as many times as necessary to\nuse up the list of input items.  In general, there will be many\nfewer invocations of\ncommand\nthan there were items in the input.\nThis will normally have significant performance benefits.  Some\ncommands can usefully be executed in parallel too; see the\n-P\nopâ\ntion.\nBecause Unix filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this deâ\nfault behaviour is often problematic; filenames containing blanks\nand/or newlines are incorrectly processed by\nxargs\n.  In these sitâ\nuations it is better to use the\n-0\noption, which prevents such\nproblems.  When using this option you will need to ensure that the\nprogram which produces the input for\nxargs\nalso uses a null charâ\nacter as a separator.  If that program is GNU\nfind\nfor example,\nthe\n-print0\noption does this for you.\nIf any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255,\nxargs\nwill stop immediately without reading any further input.  An error\nmessage is issued on stderr when this happens.\nOPTIONS\ntop\n-0, --null\nInput items are terminated by a null character instead of\nby whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special\n(every character is taken literally).  Disables the end-of-\nfile string, which is treated like any other argument.\nUseful when input items might contain white space, quote\nmarks, or backslashes.  The GNU find (and from Issue 8,\nPOSIX) -print0 option produces input suitable for this\nmode.\n-a\nfile\n, --arg-file=\nfile\nRead items from\nfile\ninstead of standard input.  If you use\nthis option, stdin remains unchanged when commands are run.\nOtherwise, stdin is redirected from\n/dev/null\n.\n--delimiter=\ndelim\n, -d\ndelim\nInput items are terminated by the specified character.  The\nspecified delimiter may be a single character, a C-style\ncharacter escape such as\n\\n\n, or an octal or hexadecimal esâ\ncape code.  Octal and hexadecimal escape codes are underâ\nstood as for the\nprintf\ncommand.  Multibyte characters are\nnot supported.  When processing the input, quotes and backâ\nslash are not special; every character in the input is takâ\nen literally.  The\n-d\noption disables any end-of-file\nstring, which is treated like any other argument.  You can\nuse this option when the input consists of simply newline-\nseparated items, although it is almost always better to deâ\nsign your program to use\n--null\nwhere this is possible.\n-E\neof-str\nSet the end-of-file string to\neof-str\n.  If the end-of-file\nstring occurs as a line of input, the rest of the input is\nignored.  If neither\n-E\nnor\n-e\nis used, no end-of-file\nstring is used.\n-e\n[\neof-str\n],\n--eof\n[\n=eof-str\n]\nThis option is a synonym for the\n-E\noption.  Use\n-E\ninâ\nstead, because it is POSIX compliant while this option is\nnot.  If\neof-str\nis omitted, there is no end-of-file\nstring.  If neither\n-E\nnor\n-e\nis used, no end-of-file\nstring is used.\n-I\nreplace-str\nReplace occurrences of\nreplace-str\nin the initial-arguments\nwith names read from standard input.  Also, unquoted blanks\ndo not terminate input items; instead the separator is the\nnewline character.  Implies\n-x\nand\n-L\n1.\n-i\n[\nreplace-str\n],\n--replace\n[\n=replace-str\n]\nThis option is a synonym for\n-I\nreplace-str\nif\nreplace-str\nis specified.  If the\nreplace-str\nargument is missing, the\neffect is the same as\n-I\n{}.  The\n-i\noption is deprecated;\nuse\n-I\ninstead.\n-L\nmax-lines\nUse at most\nmax-lines\nnonblank input lines per command\nline.  Trailing blanks cause an input line to be logically\ncontinued on the next input line.  Implies\n-x\n.\n-l\n[\nmax-lines\n],\n--max-lines\n[=\nmax-lines\n]\nSynonym for the\n-L\noption.  Unlike\n-L\n, the\nmax-lines\narguâ\nment is optional.  If\nmax-lines\nis not specified, it deâ\nfaults to one.  The\n-l\noption is deprecated since the POSIX\nstandard specifies\n-L\ninstead.\n-n\nmax-args\n,\n--max-args\n=\nmax-args\nUse at most\nmax-args\narguments per command line.  Fewer\nthan\nmax-args\narguments will be used if the size (see the\n-s\noption) is exceeded, unless the\n-x\noption is given, in\nwhich case\nxargs\nwill exit.\n-P\nmax-procs\n,\n--max-procs\n=\nmax-procs\nRun up to\nmax-procs\nprocesses at a time; the default is 1.\nIf\nmax-procs\nis 0,\nxargs\nwill run as many processes as posâ\nsible at a time.  Use the\n-n\noption or the\n-L\noption with\n-P\n; otherwise chances are that only one exec will be done.\nWhile\nxargs\nis running, you can send its process a SIGUSR1\nsignal to increase the number of commands to run simultaneâ\nously, or a SIGUSR2 to decrease the number.  You cannot inâ\ncrease it above an implementation-defined limit (which is\nshown with --show-limits).  You cannot decrease it below 1.\nxargs\nnever terminates its commands; when asked to deâ\ncrease, it merely waits for more than one existing command\nto terminate before starting another.\nxargs\nalways waits\nfor all child processes to exit before exiting itself (but\nsee BUGS).\nIf you do not use the\n-P\noption,\nxargs\nwill not handle the\nSIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals, meaning that they will termiâ\nnate the program (unless they were blocked in the parent\nprocess before\nxargs\nwas started).\nPlease note\nthat it is up to the called processes to propâ\nerly manage parallel access to shared resources.  For examâ\nple, if more than one of them tries to print to stdout, the\noutput will be produced in an indeterminate order (and very\nlikely mixed up) unless the processes collaborate in some\nway to prevent this.  Using some kind of locking scheme is\none way to prevent such problems.  In general, using a\nlocking scheme will help ensure correct output but reduce\nperformance.  If you don't want to tolerate the performance\ndifference, simply arrange for each process to produce a\nseparate output file (or otherwise use separate resources).\n-o, --open-tty\nReopen stdin as\n/dev/tty\nin the child process before exeâ\ncuting the command.  This is useful if you want\nxargs\nto\nrun an interactive application.\n-p, --interactive\nPrompt the user about whether to run each command line and\nread a line from the terminal.  Only run the command line\nif the response starts with `y' or `Y'.  Implies\n-t\n.\n--process-slot-var\n=\nname\nSet the environment variable\nname\nto a unique value in each\nrunning child process.  Values are reused once child\nprocesses exit.  This can be used in a rudimentary load\ndistribution scheme, for example.\n-r, --no-run-if-empty\nIf the standard input does not contain any nonblanks, do\nnot run the command.  Normally, the command is run once\neven if there is no input.  This option is a GNU extension.\n-s\nmax-chars\n,\n--max-chars\n=max-chars\nUse at most\nmax-chars\ncharacters per command line, includâ\ning the command and initial-arguments and the terminating\nnulls at the ends of the argument strings.  The largest alâ\nlowed value is system-dependent, and is calculated as the\nargument length limit for exec, less the size of your enviâ\nronment, less 2048 bytes of headroom.  If this value is\nmore than 128 KiB, 128 KiB is used as the default value;\notherwise, the default value is the maximum.  1 KiB is 1024\nbytes.\nxargs\nautomatically adapts to tighter constraints.\n--show-limits\nDisplay the limits on the command-line length which are imâ\nposed by the operating system,\nxargs\n' choice of buffer size\nand the\n-s\noption.  Pipe the input from\n/dev/null\n(and perâ\nhaps specify\n--no-run-if-empty\n) if you don't want\nxargs\nto\ndo anything.\n-t, --verbose\nPrint the command line on the standard error output before\nexecuting it.\n-x, --exit\nExit if the size (see the\n-s\noption) is exceeded.\n--\nDelimit the option list.  Later arguments, if any, are\ntreated as operands even if they begin with\n-\n.  For examâ\nple,\nxargs -- --help\nruns the command\n--help\n(found in\nPATH\n) instead of printing the usage text, and\nxargs --\n--mycommand\nruns the command\n--mycommand\ninstead of rejectâ\ning this as unrecognized option.\n--help\nPrint a summary of the options to\nxargs\nand exit.\n--version\nPrint the version number of\nxargs\nand exit.\nThe options\n--max-lines\n(\n-L\n,\n-l\n),\n--replace\n(\n-I\n,\n-i\n) and\n--max-\nargs\n(\n-n\n) are mutually exclusive.  If some of them are specified\nat the same time, then\nxargs\nwill generally use the option speciâ\nfied last on the command line, i.e., it will reset the value of\nthe offending option (given before) to its default value.  Addiâ\ntionally,\nxargs\nwill issue a warning diagnostic on\nstderr\n.  The\nexception to this rule is that the special\nmax-args\nvalue\n1\n('\n-n\n1\n') is ignored after the\n--replace\noption and its aliases\n-I\nand\n-i\n, because it would not actually conflict.\nEXAMPLES\ntop\nfind /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f\nFind files named\ncore\nin or below the directory\n/tmp\nand delete\nthem.  Note that this will work incorrectly if there are any fileâ\nnames containing newlines or spaces.\nfind /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f\nFind files named\ncore\nin or below the directory\n/tmp\nand delete\nthem, processing filenames in such a way that file or directory\nnames containing spaces or newlines are correctly handled.\nfind /tmp -depth -name core -type f -delete\nFind files named\ncore\nin or below the directory\n/tmp\nand delete\nthem, but more efficiently than in the previous example (because\nwe avoid the need to use\nfork(2)\nand\nexec\n(2) to launch\nrm\nand we\ndon't need the extra\nxargs\nprocess).\ncut -d: -f1 < /etc/passwd | sort | xargs echo\nGenerates a compact listing of all the users on the system.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nxargs\nexits with the following status:\n0      if it succeeds\n123    if any invocation of the command exited with status\n1â125\n124    if the command exited with status 255\n125    if the command is killed by a signal\n126    if the command cannot be run\n127    if the command is not found\n1      if some other error occurred.\nExit codes greater than 128 are used by the shell to indicate that\na program died due to a fatal signal.\nSTANDARDS CONFORMANCE\ntop\nThe long-standing\n-0\noption of\nxargs\nwill be included in Issue 8\nof the POSIX standard.\nAs of GNU xargs version 4.2.9, the default behaviour of\nxargs\nis\nnot to have a logical end-of-file marker.  POSIX (IEEE Std 1003.1,\n2004 Edition) allows this.\nThe -l and -i options appear in the 1997 version of the POSIX\nstandard, but do not appear in the 2004 version of the standard.\nTherefore you should use -L and -I instead, respectively.\nThe -o option is an extension to the POSIX standard for better\ncompatibility with BSD.\nThe POSIX standard allows implementations to have a limit on the\nsize of arguments to the\nexec\nfunctions.  This limit could be as\nlow as 4096 bytes including the size of the environment.  For\nscripts to be portable, they must not rely on a larger value.\nHowever, I know of no implementation whose actual limit is that\nsmall.  The\n--show-limits\noption can be used to discover the actuâ\nal limits in force on the current system.\nIn versions of\nxargs\nup to and including version 4.9.0, SIGUSR1\nand SIGUSR2 would not cause\nxargs\nto terminate even if the\n-P\nopâ\ntion was not used.\nHISTORY\ntop\nThe\nxargs\nprogram was invented by Herb Gellis at Bell Labs.  See\nthe Texinfo manual for findutils,\nFinding Files\n, for more informaâ\ntion.\nBUGS\ntop\nIt is not possible for\nxargs\nto be used securely, since there will\nalways be a time gap between the production of the list of input\nfiles and their use in the commands that\nxargs\nissues.  If other\nusers have access to the system, they can manipulate the filesysâ\ntem during this time window to force the action of the commands\nxargs\nruns to apply to files that you didn't intend.  For a more\ndetailed discussion of this and related problems, please refer to\nthe ``Security Considerations'' chapter in the findutils Texinfo\ndocumentation.  The\n-execdir\noption of\nfind\ncan often be used as a\nmore secure alternative.\nWhen you use the\n-I\noption, each line read from the input is\nbuffered internally.  This means that there is an upper limit on\nthe length of input line that\nxargs\nwill accept when used with the\n-I\noption.  To work around this limitation, you can use the\n-s\nopâ\ntion to increase the amount of buffer space that\nxargs\nuses, and\nyou can also use an extra invocation of\nxargs\nto ensure that very\nlong lines do not occur.  For example:\nsomecommand | xargs -s 50000 echo | xargs -I '{}' -s 100000 rm\n'{}'\nHere, the first invocation of\nxargs\nhas no input line length limit\nbecause it doesn't use the\n-i\noption.  The second invocation of\nxargs\ndoes have such a limit, but we have ensured that it never\nencounters a line which is longer than it can handle.  This is not\nan ideal solution.  Instead, the\n-i\noption should not impose a\nline length limit, which is why this discussion appears in the\nBUGS section.  The problem doesn't occur with the output of\nfind(1)\nbecause it emits just one filename per line.\nIn versions of\nxargs\nup to and including version 4.9.0,\nxargs -P\nwould exit while some of its children were still running, if one\nof them exited with status 255.\nREPORTING BUGS\ntop\nGNU findutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/finduâ\ntils/#get-help>\nReport any translation bugs to <https://translationproâ\nject.org/team/>\nReport any other issue via the form at the GNU Savannah bug trackâ\ner:\n<\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils\n>\nGeneral topics about the GNU findutils package are discussed at\nthe\nbug-findutils\nmailing list:\n<\nhttps://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-findutils\n>\nCOPYRIGHT\ntop\nCopyright Â© 1990â2025 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

For a detailed\ndiscussion, including examples and usage recommendations, refer to\nthe\nGNU Tar Manual\navailable in texinfo format.  If the\ninfo\nreader and the tar documentation are properly installed on your\nsystem, the command\ninfo tar\nshould give you access to the complete manual.\nYou can also view the manual using the info mode in\nemacs\n(1), or\nfind it in various formats online at\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual\nIf any discrepancies occur between this manpage and the\nGNU Tar\nManual\n, the later shall be considered the authoritative source.\nDESCRIPTION\ntop\nGNU\ntar\nis an archiving program designed to store multiple files\nin a single file (an\narchive\n), and to manipulate such archives.\nThe archive can be either a regular file or a device (e.g., a tape\ndrive, hence the name of the program, which stands for\nt\nape\nar\nchiver), which can be located either on the local or on a remote\nmachine.\nOption styles\nOptions to GNU\ntar\ncan be given in three different styles.  In\ntraditional style\n, the first argument is a cluster of option\nletters and all subsequent arguments supply arguments to those\noptions that require them.  The arguments are read in the same\norder as the option letters.  Any command line words that remain\nafter all options have been processed are treated as non-option\narguments: file or archive member names.\nFor example, the\nc\noption requires creating the archive, the\nv\noption requests the verbose operation, and the\nf\noption takes an\nargument that sets the name of the archive to operate upon.  The\nfollowing command, written in the traditional style, instructs tar\nto store all files from the directory\n/etc\ninto the archive file\netc.tar\n, verbosely listing the files being archived:\ntar cfv etc.tar /etc\nIn\nUNIX\nor\nshort-option style\n, each option letter is prefixed with\na single dash, as in other command line utilities.  If an option\ntakes an argument, the argument follows it, either as a separate\ncommand line word, or immediately following the option.  However,\nif the option takes an\noptional\nargument, the argument must follow\nthe option letter without any intervening whitespace, as in\n-g/tmp/snar.db\n.\nAny number of options not taking arguments can be clustered\ntogether after a single dash, e.g.\n-vkp\n.  An option that takes an\nargument (whether mandatory or optional) can appear at the end of\nsuch a cluster, e.g.\n-vkpf a.tar\n.\nThe example command above written in the\nshort-option style\ncould\nlook like:\ntar -cvf etc.tar /etc\nor\ntar -c -v -f etc.tar /etc\nIn\nGNU\nor\nlong-option style\n, each option begins with two dashes\nand has a meaningful name, consisting of lower-case letters and\ndashes.  When used, the long option can be abbreviated to its\ninitial letters, provided that this does not create ambiguity.\nArguments to long options are supplied either as a separate\ncommand line word, immediately following the option, or separated\nfrom the option by an equals sign with no intervening whitespace.\nOptional arguments must always use the latter method.\nHere are several ways of writing the example command in this\nstyle:\ntar --create --file etc.tar --verbose /etc\nor (abbreviating some options):\ntar --cre --file=etc.tar --verb /etc\nThe options in all three styles can be intermixed, although doing\nso with old options is not encouraged.\nOperation mode\nThe options listed in the table below tell GNU\ntar\nwhat operation\nit is to perform.  Exactly one of them must be given.  The meaning\nof non-option arguments depends on the operation mode requested.\n-A\n,\n--catenate\n,\n--concatenate\nAppend archives to the end of another archive.  The\narguments are treated as the names of archives to append.\nAll archives must be of the same format as the archive they\nare appended to, otherwise the resulting archive might be\nunusable with non-GNU implementations of\ntar\n.  Notice also\nthat when more than one archive is given, the members from\narchives other than the first one will be accessible in the\nresulting archive only when using the\n-i\n(\n--ignore-zeros\n)\noption.\nCompressed archives cannot be concatenated.\n-c\n,\n--create\nCreate a new archive.  Arguments supply the names of the\nfiles to be archived.  Directories are archived\nrecursively, unless the\n--no-recursion\noption is given.\n-d\n,\n--diff\n,\n--compare\nFind differences between archive and file system.  The\narguments are optional and specify archive members to\ncompare.  If not given, the current working directory is\nassumed.\n--delete\nDelete from the archive.  The arguments supply names of the\narchive members to be removed.  At least one argument must\nbe given.\nThis option does not operate on compressed archives.  There\nis no short option equivalent.\n-r\n,\n--append\nAppend files to the end of an archive.  Arguments have the\nsame meaning as for\n-c\n(\n--create\n).\n-t\n,\n--list\nList the contents of an archive.  Arguments are optional.\nWhen given, they specify the names of the members to list.\n--test-label\nTest the archive volume label and exit.  When used without\narguments, it prints the volume label (if any) and exits\nwith status\n0\n.  When one or more command line arguments are\ngiven.\ntar\ncompares the volume label with each argument.\nIt exits with code\n0\nif a match is found, and with code\n1\notherwise.  No output is displayed, unless used together\nwith the\n-v\n(\n--verbose\n) option.\nThere is no short option equivalent for this option.\n-u\n,\n--update\nAppend files which are newer than the corresponding copy in\nthe archive.  Arguments have the same meaning as with the\n-c\nand\n-r\noptions.  Notice, that newer files don't replace\ntheir old archive copies, but instead are appended to the\nend of archive.  The resulting archive can thus contain\nseveral members of the same name, corresponding to various\nversions of the same file.\n-x\n,\n--extract\n,\n--get\nExtract files from an archive.  Arguments are optional.\nWhen given, they specify names of the archive members to be\nextracted.\n--show-defaults\nShow built-in defaults for various\ntar\noptions and exit.\n-?\n,\n--help\nDisplay a short option summary and exit.\n--usage\nDisplay a list of available options and exit.\n--version\nPrint program version and copyright information and exit.\nOPTIONS\ntop\nOperation modifiers\n--check-device\nCheck device numbers when creating incremental archives\n(default).\n-g\n,\n--listed-incremental\n=\nFILE\nHandle new GNU-format incremental backups.\nFILE\nis the\nname of a\nsnapshot file\n, where\ntar\nstores additional\ninformation which is used to decide which files changed\nsince the previous incremental dump and, consequently, must\nbe dumped again.  If\nFILE\ndoes not exist when creating an\narchive, it will be created and all files will be added to\nthe resulting archive (the\nlevel 0\ndump).  To create\nincremental archives of non-zero level\nN\n, you need a copy\nof the snapshot file created for level\nN-1\n, and use it as\nFILE\n.\nWhen listing or extracting, the actual content of\nFILE\nis\nnot inspected, it is needed only due to syntactical\nrequirements.  It is therefore common practice to use\n/dev/null\nin its place.\n--hole-detection\n=\nMETHOD\nUse\nMETHOD\nto detect holes in sparse files.  This option\nimplies\n--sparse\n.  Valid values for\nMETHOD\nare\nseek\nand\nraw\n.  Default is\nseek\nwith fallback to\nraw\nwhen not\napplicable.\n-G\n,\n--incremental\nHandle old GNU-format incremental backups.\n--ignore-failed-read\nDo not exit with nonzero on unreadable files.\n--level\n=\nNUMBER\nSet dump level for a created listed-incremental archive.\nCurrently only\n--level=0\nis meaningful: it instructs\ntar\nto\ntruncate the snapshot file before dumping, thereby forcing\na level 0 dump.\n-n\n,\n--seek\nAssume the archive is seekable.  Normally\ntar\ndetermines\nautomatically whether the archive can be seeked or not.\nThis option is intended for use in cases when such\nrecognition fails.  It takes effect only if the archive is\nopen for reading (e.g., with\n--list\nor\n--extract\noptions).\n--no-check-device\nDo not check device numbers when creating incremental\narchives.\n--no-seek\nAssume the archive is not seekable.\n--occurrence\n[=\nN\n]\nProcess only the\nN\nth occurrence of each file in the\narchive.  This option is valid only when used with one of\nthe following subcommands:\n--delete\n,\n--diff\n,\n--extract\nor\n--list\nand when a list of files is given either on the\ncommand line or via the\n-T\noption.  The default\nN\nis\n1\n.\n--restrict\nDisable the use of some potentially harmful options.\n--sparse-version\n=\nMAJOR\n[.\nMINOR\n]\nSet which version of the sparse format to use.  This option\nimplies\n--sparse\n.  Valid argument values are\n0.0\n,\n0.1\n, and\n1.0\n.  For a detailed discussion of sparse formats, refer to\nthe\nGNU Tar Manual\n, appendix\nD\n, \"\nSparse Formats\n\".  Using\nthe\ninfo\nreader, it can be accessed running the following\ncommand:\ninfo tar 'Sparse Formats'\n.\n-S\n,\n--sparse\nHandle sparse files efficiently.  Some files in the file\nsystem may have segments which were actually never written\n(quite often these are database files created by such\nsystems as\nDBM\n).  When given this option,\ntar\nattempts to\ndetermine if the file is sparse prior to archiving it, and\nif so, to reduce the resulting archive size by not dumping\nempty parts of the file.\nOverwrite control\nThese options control\ntar\nactions when extracting a file over an\nexisting copy on disk.\n-k\n,\n--keep-old-files\nDon't replace existing files when extracting.\n--keep-newer-files\nDon't replace existing files that are newer than their\narchive copies.\n--keep-directory-symlink\nDon't replace existing symlinks to directories when\nextracting.\n--no-overwrite-dir\nPreserve metadata of existing directories.\n--one-top-level\n[\n=\nDIR\n]\nExtract all files into\nDIR\n, or, if used without argument,\ninto a subdirectory named by the base name of the archive\n(minus standard compression suffixes recognizable by\n--auto-compress).\n--overwrite\nOverwrite existing files when extracting.\n--overwrite-dir\nOverwrite metadata of existing directories when extracting\n(default).\n--recursive-unlink\nRecursively remove all files in the directory prior to\nextracting it.\n--remove-files\nRemove files from disk after adding them to the archive.\n--skip-old-files\nDon't replace existing files when extracting, silently skip\nover them.\n-U\n,\n--unlink-first\nRemove each file prior to extracting over it.\n-W\n,\n--verify\nVerify the archive after writing it.\nOutput stream selection\n--ignore-command-error\nIgnore subprocess exit codes.\n--no-ignore-command-error\nTreat non-zero exit codes of children as error (default).\n-O\n,\n--to-stdout\nExtract files to standard output.\n--to-command\n=\nCOMMAND\nPipe extracted files to\nCOMMAND\n.  The argument is the\npathname of an external program, optionally with command\nline arguments.  The program will be invoked and the\ncontents of the file being extracted supplied to it on its\nstandard input.  Additional data will be supplied via the\nfollowing environment variables:\nTAR_FILETYPE\nType of the file. It is a single letter with the\nfollowing meaning:\nf           Regular file\nd           Directory\nl           Symbolic link\nh           Hard link\nb           Block device\nc           Character device\nCurrently only regular files are supported.\nTAR_MODE\nFile mode, an octal number.\nTAR_FILENAME\nThe name of the file.\nTAR_REALNAME\nName of the file as stored in the archive.\nTAR_UNAME\nName of the file owner.\nTAR_GNAME\nName of the file owner group.\nTAR_ATIME\nTime of last access. It is a decimal number,\nrepresenting seconds since the Epoch.  If the\narchive provides times with nanosecond precision,\nthe nanoseconds are appended to the timestamp after\na decimal point.\nTAR_MTIME\nTime of last modification.\nTAR_CTIME\nTime of last status change.\nTAR_SIZE\nSize of the file.\nTAR_UID\nUID of the file owner.\nTAR_GID\nGID of the file owner.\nAdditionally, the following variables contain information\nabout\ntar\noperation mode and the archive being processed:\nTAR_VERSION\nGNU\ntar\nversion number.\nTAR_ARCHIVE\nThe name of the archive\ntar\nis processing.\nTAR_BLOCKING_FACTOR\nCurrent blocking factor, i.e., number of 512-byte\nblocks in a record.\nTAR_VOLUME\nOrdinal number of the volume\ntar\nis processing (set\nif reading a multi-volume archive).\nTAR_FORMAT\nFormat of the archive being processed.  One of:\ngnu\n,\noldgnu\n,\nposix\n,\nustar\n,\nv7\n.\nTAR_SUBCOMMAND\nA short option (with a leading dash) describing the\noperation\ntar\nis executing.\nHandling of file attributes\n--atime-preserve\n[=\nMETHOD\n]\nPreserve access times on dumped files, either by restoring\nthe times after reading (\nMETHOD\n=\nreplace\n, this is the\ndefault) or by not setting the times in the first place\n(\nMETHOD\n=\nsystem\n).\n--delay-directory-restore\nDelay setting modification times and permissions of\nextracted directories until the end of extraction.  Use\nthis option when extracting from an archive which has\nunusual member ordering.\n--group\n=\nNAME\n[:\nGID\n]\nForce\nNAME\nas group for added files.  If\nGID\nis not\nsupplied,\nNAME\ncan be either a user name or numeric GID.\nIn this case the missing part (GID or name) will be\ninferred from the current host's group database.\nWhen used with\n--group-map\n=\nFILE\n, affects only those files\nwhose owner group is not listed in\nFILE\n.\n--group-map\n=\nFILE\nRead group translation map from\nFILE\n.  Empty lines are\nignored.  Comments are introduced with\n#\nsign and extend to\nthe end of line.  Each non-empty line in\nFILE\ndefines\ntranslation for a single group.  It must consist of two\nfields, delimited by any amount of whitespace:\nOLDGRP NEWGRP\n[\n:\nNEWGID\n]\nOLDGRP\nis either a valid group name or a GID prefixed with\n+\n.  Unless\nNEWGID\nis supplied,\nNEWGRP\nmust also be either a\nvalid group name or a\n+\nGID\n.  Otherwise, both\nNEWGRP\nand\nNEWGID\nneed not be listed in the system group database.\nAs a result, each input file with owner group\nOLDGRP\nwill\nbe stored in archive with owner group\nNEWGRP\nand GID\nNEWGID\n.\n--mode\n=\nCHANGES\nForce symbolic mode\nCHANGES\nfor added files.\n--mtime\n=\nDATE-OR-FILE\nSet mtime for added files.\nDATE-OR-FILE\nis either a\ndate/time in almost arbitrary format, or the name of an\nexisting file.

If\nUID\nis not\nsupplied,\nNAME\ncan be either a user name or numeric UID.\nIn this case the missing part (UID or name) will be\ninferred from the current host's user database.\nWhen used with\n--owner-map\n=\nFILE\n, affects only those files\nwhose owner is not listed in\nFILE\n.\n--owner-map\n=\nFILE\nRead owner translation map from\nFILE\n.  Empty lines are\nignored.  Comments are introduced with\n#\nsign and extend to\nthe end of line.  Each non-empty line in\nFILE\ndefines\ntranslation for a single UID.  It must consist of two\nfields, delimited by any amount of whitespace:\nOLDUSR NEWUSR\n[\n:\nNEWUID\n]\nOLDUSR\nis either a valid user name or a UID prefixed with\n+\n.  Unless\nNEWUID\nis supplied,\nNEWUSR\nmust also be either a\nvalid user name or a\n+\nUID\n.  Otherwise, both\nNEWUSR\nand\nNEWUID\nneed not be listed in the system user database.\nAs a result, each input file owned by\nOLDUSR\nwill be stored\nin archive with owner name\nNEWUSR\nand UID\nNEWUID\n.\n-p\n,\n--preserve-permissions\n,\n--same-permissions\nSet permissions of extracted files to those recorded in the\narchive (default for superuser).\n--same-owner\nTry extracting files with the same ownership as exists in\nthe archive (default for superuser).\n-s\n,\n--preserve-order\n,\n--same-order\nTell\ntar\nthat the list of file names to process is sorted\nin the same order as the files in the archive.\n--sort=\nORDER\nWhen creating an archive, sort directory entries according\nto\nORDER\n, which is one of\nnone\n,\nname\n, or\ninode\n.\nThe default is\n--sort=none\n, which stores archive members in\nthe same order as returned by the operating system.\nUsing\n--sort=name\nensures the member ordering in the\ncreated archive is uniform and reproducible.\nUsing\n--sort=inode\nreduces the number of disk seeks made\nwhen creating the archive and thus can considerably speed\nup archivation.  This sorting order is supported only if\nthe underlying system provides the necessary information.\nExtended file attributes\n--acls\nEnable POSIX ACLs support.\n--no-acls\nDisable POSIX ACLs support.\n--selinux\nEnable SELinux context support.\n--no-selinux\nDisable SELinux context support.\n--xattrs\nEnable extended attributes support.\n--no-xattrs\nDisable extended attributes support.\n--xattrs-exclude=\nPATTERN\nSpecify the exclude pattern for xattr keys.\nPATTERN\nis a\nglobbing pattern, e.g.\n--xattrs-exclude='user.*'\nto include\nonly attributes from the user namespace.\n--xattrs-include=\nPATTERN\nSpecify the include pattern for xattr keys.\nPATTERN\nis a\nglobbing pattern.\nDevice selection and switching\n-f\n,\n--file\n=\nARCHIVE\nUse archive file or device\nARCHIVE\n.  If this option is not\ngiven,\ntar\nwill first examine the environment variable\n`TAPE'.  If it is set, its value will be used as the\narchive name.  Otherwise,\ntar\nwill assume the compiled-in\ndefault.  The default value can be inspected either using\nthe\n--show-defaults\noption, or at the end of the\ntar --help\noutput.\nAn archive name that has a colon in it specifies a file or\ndevice on a remote machine.  The part before the colon is\ntaken as the machine name or IP address, and the part after\nit as the file or device pathname, e.g.:\n--file=remotehost:/dev/sr0\nAn optional username can be prefixed to the hostname,\nplacing a\n@\nsign between them.\nBy default, the remote host is accessed via the\nrsh\n(1)\ncommand.  Nowadays it is common to use\nssh(1)\ninstead.  You\ncan do so by giving the following command line option:\n--rsh-command=/usr/bin/ssh\nThe remote machine should have the\nrmt\n(8) command\ninstalled.  If its pathname does not match\ntar\n's default,\nyou can inform\ntar\nabout the correct pathname using the\n--rmt-command\noption.\n--force-local\nArchive file is local even if it has a colon.\n-F\n,\n--info-script\n=\nCOMMAND\n,\n--new-volume-script\n=\nCOMMAND\nRun\nCOMMAND\nat the end of each tape (implies\n-M\n).  The\ncommand can include arguments.  When started, it will\ninherit\ntar\n's environment plus the following variables:\nTAR_VERSION\nGNU\ntar\nversion number.\nTAR_ARCHIVE\nThe name of the archive\ntar\nis processing.\nTAR_BLOCKING_FACTOR\nCurrent blocking factor, i.e., number of 512-byte\nblocks in a record.\nTAR_VOLUME\nOrdinal number of the volume\ntar\nis processing (set\nif reading a multi-volume archive).\nTAR_FORMAT\nFormat of the archive being processed.

If\nN\nis followed\nby a size suffix (see the subsection\nSize suffixes\nbelow),\nthe suffix specifies the multiplicative factor to be used\ninstead of 1024.\nThis option implies\n-M\n.\n-M\n,\n--multi-volume\nCreate/list/extract multi-volume archive.\n--rmt-command\n=\nCOMMAND\nUse\nCOMMAND\ninstead of\nrmt\nwhen accessing remote archives.\nSee the description of the\n-f\noption, above.\n--rsh-command\n=\nCOMMAND\nUse\nCOMMAND\ninstead of\nrsh\nwhen accessing remote archives.\nSee the description of the\n-f\noption, above.\n--volno-file\n=\nFILE\nWhen this option is used in conjunction with\n--multi-volume\n,\ntar\nwill keep track of which volume of a\nmulti-volume archive it is working in\nFILE\n.\nDevice blocking\n-b\n,\n--blocking-factor\n=\nBLOCKS\nSet record size to\nBLOCKS\nx\n512\nbytes.\n-B\n,\n--read-full-records\nWhen listing or extracting, accept incomplete input records\nafter end-of-file marker.\n-i\n,\n--ignore-zeros\nIgnore zeroed blocks in archive.  Normally two consecutive\n512-blocks filled with zeroes mean EOF and\ntar\nstops\nreading after encountering them.  This option instructs it\nto read further and is useful when reading archives created\nwith the\n-A\noption.\n--record-size\n=\nNUMBER\nSet record size.\nNUMBER\nis the number of bytes per record.\nIt must be multiple of\n512\n.  It can can be suffixed with a\nsize suffix\n, e.g.\n--record-size=10K\n, for 10 Kilobytes.  See\nthe subsection\nSize suffixes\n, for a list of valid suffixes.\nArchive format selection\n-H\n,\n--format\n=\nFORMAT\nCreate archive of the given format.  Valid formats are:\ngnu\nGNU tar 1.13.x format\noldgnu\nGNU format as per tar <= 1.12.\npax\n,\nposix\nPOSIX 1003.1-2001 (pax) format.\nustar\nPOSIX 1003.1-1988 (ustar) format.\nv7\nOld V7 tar format.\n--old-archive\n,\n--portability\nSame as\n--format=v7\n.\n--pax-option\n=\nkeyword\n[[:]=\nvalue\n][,\nkeyword\n[[:]=\nvalue\n]]...\nControl pax keywords when creating\nPAX\narchives (\n-H pax\n).\nThis option is equivalent to the\n-o\noption of the\npax\n(1)\nutility.\n--posix\nSame as\n--format=posix\n.\n-V\n,\n--label\n=\nTEXT\nCreate archive with volume name\nTEXT\n.

The\nCACHEDIR.TAG\nfile must be a regular file whose content\nbegins with the following 43 characters:\nSignature: 8a477f597d28d172789f06886806bc55\n--exclude-caches-all\nExclude directories containing file\nCACHEDIR.TAG\nand the\nfile itself.\n--exclude-caches-under\nExclude everything under directories containing\nCACHEDIR.TAG\n--exclude-ignore=\nFILE\nBefore dumping a directory, see if it contains\nFILE\n.  If\nso, read exclusion patterns from this file.

If\nDATE\nstarts with\n/\nor\n.\nit is taken to be a file name; the mtime\nof that file is used as the date.\n--no-null\nDisable the effect of the previous\n--null\noption.\n--no-recursion\nAvoid descending automatically in directories.\n--no-unquote\nDo not unquote input file or member names.\n--no-verbatim-files-from\nTreat each line read from a file list as if it were\nsupplied in the command line.  I.e., leading and trailing\nwhitespace is removed and, if the resulting string begins\nwith a dash, it is treated as\ntar\ncommand line option.\nThis is the default behavior.  The\n--no-verbatim-files-from\noption is provided as a way to restore it after\n--verbatim-files-from\noption.\nThis option is positional: it affects all\n--files-from\noptions that occur after it in, until\n--verbatim-files-from\noption or end of line, whichever occurs first.\nIt is implied by the\n--no-null\noption.\n--null\nInstruct subsequent\n-T\noptions to read null-terminated\nnames verbatim (disables special handling of names that\nstart with a dash).\nSee also\n--verbatim-files-from\n.\n-N\n,\n--newer\n=\nDATE\n,\n--after-date\n=\nDATE\nOnly store files newer than DATE.

The\nnames read are handled the same way as command line\narguments.  They undergo quote removal and word splitting,\nand any string that starts with a\n-\nis handled as\ntar\ncommand line option.\nIf this behavior is undesirable, it can be turned off using\nthe\n--verbatim-files-from\noption.\nThe\n--null\noption instructs\ntar\nthat the names in\nFILE\nare\nseparated by ASCII\nNUL\ncharacter, instead of\nLF\n.  It is\nuseful if the list is generated by\nfind(1)\n-print0\npredicate.\n--unquote\nUnquote file or member names (default).\n--verbatim-files-from\nTreat each line obtained from a file list as a file name,\neven if it starts with a dash.  File lists are supplied\nwith the\n--files-from\n(\n-T\n) option.  The default behavior is\nto handle names supplied in file lists as if they were\ntyped in the command line, i.e., any names starting with a\ndash are treated as\ntar\noptions.  The\n--verbatim-files-from\noption disables this behavior.\nThis option affects all\n--files-from\noptions that occur\nafter it in the command line.

It supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER,\nGOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S,\nRTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET,\nTFTP, WS and WSS.\ncurl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See\nlibcurl\n(3) for details.\nURL\ntop\nThe URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed\ndescription in RFC 3986.\nIf you provide a URL without a leading\nprotocol://\nscheme, curl\nguesses what protocol you want. It then defaults to HTTP but\nassumes others based on often-used host name prefixes. For\nexample, for host names starting with \"ftp.\" curl assumes you want\nFTP.\nYou can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They are\nfetched in a sequential manner in the specified order unless you\nuse\n-Z, --parallel\n. You can specify command line options and URLs\nmixed and in any order on the command line.\ncurl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers,\nso that getting many files from the same server do not use\nmultiple connects and setup handshakes. This improves speed.\nConnection reuse can only be done for URLs specified for a single\ncommand line invocation and cannot be performed between separate\ncurl runs.\nProvide an IPv6 zone id in the URL with an escaped percentage\nsign. Like in\n\"http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/\"\nEverything provided on the command line that is not a command line\noption or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as\nsuch.\nGLOBBING\ntop\nYou can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing lists\nwithin braces or ranges within brackets. We call this \"globbing\".\nProvide a list with three different names like this:\n\"http://site.{one,two,three}.com\"\nor you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\"\n\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt\"    (with leading zeros)\n\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\"\nNested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones\nnext to each other:\n\"http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\"\nYou can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth\nnumber or letter:\n\"http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt\"\n\"http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt\"\nWhen using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line\nprompt, you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes\nto avoid the shell from interfering with it. This also goes for\nother characters treated special, like for example '&', '?' and\n'*'.\nSwitch off globbing with\n-g, --globoff\n.\nVARIABLES\ntop\ncurl supports command line variables (added in 8.3.0). Set\nvariables with\n--variable\nname=content or\n--variable\nname@file\n(where \"file\" can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)).\nVariable contents can expanded in option parameters using\n\"{{name}}\" (without the quotes) if the option name is prefixed\nwith \"--expand-\". This gets the contents of the variable \"name\"\ninserted, or a blank if the name does not exist as a variable.\nInsert \"{{\" verbatim in the string by prefixing it with a\nbackslash, like \"\\{{\".\nYou an access and expand environment variables by first importing\nthem. You can select to either require the environment variable to\nbe set or you can provide a default value in case it is not\nalready set. Plain\n--variable\n%name imports the variable called\n'name' but exits with an error if that environment variable is not\nalready set. To provide a default value if it is not set, use\n--variable\n%name=content or\n--variable\n%name@content.\nExample. Get the USER environment variable into the URL, fail if\nUSER is not set:\n--variable '%USER'\n--expand-url = \"https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method\"\nWhen expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that\ncan make the variable contents more convenient to use. It can trim\nleading and trailing white space with\ntrim\n, it can output the\ncontents as a JSON quoted string with\njson\n, URL encode the string\nwith\nurl\nor base64 encode it with\nb64\n. You apply function to a\nvariable expansion, add them colon separated to the right side of\nthe variable. Variable content holding null bytes that are not\nencoded when expanded cause error.\nExample: get the contents of a file called $HOME/.secret into a\nvariable called \"fix\". Make sure that the content is trimmed and\npercent-encoded sent as POST data:\n--variable %HOME\n--expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret\n--expand-data \"{{fix:trim:url}}\"\nhttps://example.com/\nCommand line variables and expansions were added in in 8.3.0.\nOUTPUT\ntop\nIf not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It\ncan be instructed to instead save that data into a local file,\nusing the\n-o, --output\nor\n-O, --remote-name\noptions. If curl is\ngiven multiple URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly\nneeds multiple options for where to save them.\ncurl does not parse or otherwise \"understand\" the content it gets\nor writes as output. It does no encoding or decoding, unless\nexplicitly asked to with dedicated command line options.\nPROTOCOLS\ntop\ncurl supports numerous protocols, or put in URL terms: schemes.\nYour particular build may not support them all.\nDICT   Lets you lookup words using online dictionaries.\nFILE   Read or write local files. curl does not support accessing\nfile:// URL remotely, but when running on Microsoft Windows\nusing the native UNC approach works.\nFTP(S) curl supports the File Transfer Protocol with a lot of\ntweaks and levers. With or without using TLS.\nGOPHER(S)\nRetrieve files.\nHTTP(S)\ncurl supports HTTP with numerous options and variations. It\ncan speak HTTP version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2 and 3 depending on\nbuild options and the correct command line options.\nIMAP(S)\nUsing the mail reading protocol, curl can \"download\" emails\nfor you. With or without using TLS.\nLDAP(S)\ncurl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.\nMQTT   curl supports MQTT version 3. Downloading over MQTT equals\n\"subscribe\" to a topic while uploading/posting equals\n\"publish\" on a topic. MQTT over TLS is not supported (yet).\nPOP3(S)\nDownloading from a pop3 server means getting a mail. With\nor without using TLS.\nRTMP(S)\nThe Realtime Messaging Protocol is primarily used to serve\nstreaming media and curl can download it.\nRTSP   curl supports RTSP 1.0 downloads.\nSCP    curl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.\nSFTP   curl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.\nSMB(S) curl supports SMB version 1 for upload and download.\nSMTP(S)\nUploading contents to an SMTP server means sending an\nemail. With or without TLS.\nTELNET Telling curl to fetch a telnet URL starts an interactive\nsession where it sends what it reads on stdin and outputs\nwhat the server sends it.\nTFTP   curl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.\nPROGRESS METER\ntop\ncurl normally displays a progress meter during operations,\nindicating the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and\nestimated time left, etc. The progress meter displays the transfer\nrate in bytes per second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024\nbased. For example 1k is 1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.\ncurl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you\ninvoke curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to\nthe terminal, it\ndisables\nthe progress meter as otherwise it would\nmess up the output mixing progress meter and response data.\nIf you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you\nneed to redirect the response output to a file, using shell\nredirect (>),\n-o, --output\nor similar.\nThis does not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit\nout any response data to the terminal.\nIf you prefer a progress \"bar\" instead of the regular meter,\n-#,\n--progress-bar\nis your friend. You can also disable the progress\nmeter completely with the\n-s, --silent\noption.\nVERSION\ntop\nThis man page describes curl 8.6.0. If you use a later version,\nchances are this man page does not fully document it. If you use\nan earlier version, this document tries to include version\ninformation about which specific version that introduced changes.\nYou can always learn which the latest curl version is by running\ncurl\nhttps://curl.se/info\nThe online version of this man page is always showing the latest\nincarnation:\nhttps://curl.se/docs/manpage.html\nOPTIONS\ntop\nOptions start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require\nan additional value next to them. If provided text does not start\nwith a dash, it is presumed to be and treated as a URL.\nThe short \"single-dash\" form of the options, -d for example, may\nbe used with or without a space between it and its value, although\na space is a recommended separator. The long \"double-dash\" form,\n-d, --data\nfor example, requires a space between it and its value.\nShort version options that do not need any additional values can\nbe used immediately next to each other, like for example you can\nspecify all the options\n-O\n,\n-L\nand\n-v\nat once as\n-OLv\n.\nIn general, all boolean options are enabled with --\noption\nand yet\nagain disabled with --\nno-\noption. That is, you use the same option\nname but prefix it with \"no-\". However, in this list we mostly\nonly list and show the\n--option\nversion of them.\nWhen\n-:, --next\nis used, it resets the parser state and you start\nagain with a clean option state, except for the options that are\n\"global\". Global options retain their values and meaning even\nafter\n-:, --next\n.\nThe following options are global:\n--fail-early\n,\n--libcurl\n,\n--parallel-immediate\n,\n-Z, --parallel\n,\n-#, --progress-bar\n,\n--rate\n,\n-S, --show-error\n,\n--stderr\n,\n--styled-output\n,\n--trace-ascii\n,\n--trace-config\n,\n--trace-ids\n,\n--trace-time\n,\n--trace\nand\n-v,\n--verbose\n.\n--abstract-unix-socket <path>\n(HTTP) Connect through an abstract Unix domain socket,\ninstead of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path\nof an abstract socket prefixed with '@', however the <path>\nargument should not have this leading character.\nIf\n--abstract-unix-socket\nis provided several times, the\nlast set value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--unix-socket\n. Added in 7.53.0.\n--alt-svc <file name>\n(HTTPS) This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If\nthe file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file,\nthat gets used. After a completed transfer, the cache is\nsaved to the file name again if it has been modified.\nSpecify a \"\" file name (zero length) to avoid\nloading/saving and make curl just handle the cache in\nmemory.\nIf this option is used several times, curl loads contents\nfrom all the files but the last one is used for saving.\n--alt-svc\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --alt-svc svc.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--resolve\nand\n--connect-to\n. Added in 7.64.1.\n--anyauth\n(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by\nitself, and use the most secure one the remote site claims\nto support. This is done by first doing a request and\nchecking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an\nextra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a\nspecific authentication method, which you can do with\n--basic\n,\n--digest\n,\n--ntlm\n, and\n--negotiate\n.\nUsing\n--anyauth\nis not recommended if you do uploads from\nstdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then\nthe client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise\nwhen uploading from stdin, the upload operation fails.\nUsed together with\n-u, --user\n.\nProviding\n--anyauth\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --anyauth --user me:pwd\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-anyauth\n,\n--basic\nand\n--digest\n.\n-a, --append\n(FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this option makes curl\nappend to the target file instead of overwriting it. If the\nremote file does not exist, it is created. Note that this\nflag is ignored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).\nProviding\n-a, --append\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-append.\nExample:\ncurl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n-r, --range\nand\n-C, --continue-at\n.\n--aws-sigv4 <provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]>\n(HTTP) Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.\nThe provider argument is a string that is used by the\nalgorithm when creating outgoing authentication headers.\nThe region argument is a string that points to a geographic\narea of a resources collection (region-code) when the\nregion name is omitted from the endpoint.\nThe service argument is a string that points to a function\nprovided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is\nomitted from the endpoint.\nIf\n--aws-sigv4\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --aws-sigv4 \"aws:amz:us-east-2:es\" --user \"key:secret\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--basic\nand\n-u, --user\n. Added in 7.75.0.\n--basic\n(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the\nremote host. This is the default and this option is usually\npointless, unless you use it to override a previously set\noption that sets a different authentication method (such as\n--ntlm\n,\n--digest\n, or\n--negotiate\n).\nUsed together with\n-u, --user\n.\nProviding\n--basic\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl -u name:password --basic\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-basic\n.\n--ca-native\n(TLS) Tells curl to use the CA store from the native\noperating system to verify the peer. By default, curl\notherwise uses a CA store provided in a single file or\ndirectory, but when using this option it interfaces the\noperating system's own vault.\nThis option only works for curl on Windows when built to\nuse OpenSSL. When curl on Windows is built to use Schannel,\nthis feature is implied and curl then only uses the native\nCA store.\ncurl built with wolfSSL also supports this option (added in\n8.3.0).\nProviding\n--ca-native\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-ca-native.\nExample:\ncurl --ca-native\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--cacert\n,\n--capath\nand\n-k, --insecure\n. Added in\n8.2.0.\n--cacert <file>\n(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to\nverify the peer. The file may contain multiple CA\ncertificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format.\nNormally curl is built to use a default file for this, so\nthis option is typically used to alter that default file.\ncurl recognizes the environment variable named\n'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is set, and uses the given path as a\npath to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that\nvariable.\nThe windows version of curl automatically looks for a CA\ncerts file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same\ndirectory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory,\nor in any folder along your PATH.\n(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure\nTransport, then this option is supported for backward\ncompatibility with other SSL engines, but it should not be\nset. If the option is not set, then curl uses the\ncertificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the\npeer, which is the preferred method of verifying the peer's\ncertificate chain.\n(Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in\nWindows 7 or later (added in 7.60.0). This option is\nsupported for backward compatibility with other SSL\nengines; instead it is recommended to use Windows' store of\nroot certificates (the default for Schannel).\nIf\n--cacert\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --cacert CA-file.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--capath\nand\n-k, --insecure\n.\n--capath <dir>\n(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory\nto verify the peer. Multiple paths can be provided by\nseparating them with \":\" (e.g.  \"path1:path2:path3\"). The\ncertificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is built\nagainst OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed\nusing the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using\n--capath\ncan allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make\nSSL-connections much more efficiently than using\n--cacert\nif the\n--cacert\nfile contains many CA certificates.\nIf this option is set, the default capath value is ignored.\nIf\n--capath\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --capath /local/directory\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--cacert\nand\n-k, --insecure\n.\n-E, --cert <certificate[:password]>\n(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate\nfile when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another\nSSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in PKCS#12\nformat if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if using\nany other engine. If the optional password is not\nspecified, it is queried for on the terminal. Note that\nthis option assumes a certificate file that is the private\nkey and the client certificate concatenated. See\n-E, --cert\nand\n--key\nto specify them independently.\nIn the <certificate> portion of the argument, you must\nescape the character \":\" as \"\\:\" so that it is not\nrecognized as the password delimiter. Similarly, you must\nescape the character \"\\\" as \"\\\\\" so that it is not\nrecognized as an escape character.\nIf curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine\npkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be\nused to specify a certificate located in a PKCS#11 device.\nA string beginning with \"pkcs11:\" is interpreted as a\nPKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the\n--engine\noption is set as \"pkcs11\" if none was provided and\nthe\n--cert-type\noption is set as \"ENG\" if none was\nprovided.\n(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure\nTransport, then the certificate string can either be the\nname of a certificate/private key in the system or user\nkeychain, or the path to a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and\nprivate key. If you want to use a file from the current\ndirectory, please precede it with \"./\" prefix, in order to\navoid confusion with a nickname.\n(Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a\npath expression to a certificate store. (Loading\nPFX\nis not\nsupported; you can import it to a store first). You can use\n\"<store location>\\<store name>\\<thumbprint>\" to refer to a\ncertificate in the system certificates store, for example,\n\"CurrentUser\\MY\\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a\"\n.\nThumbprint is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see\nin certificate details. Following store locations are\nsupported:\nCurrentUser\n,\nLocalMachine\n,\nCurrentService\n,\nServices\n,\nCurrentUserGroupPolicy\n,\nLocalMachineGroupPolicy\nand\nLocalMachineEnterprise\n.\nIf\n-E, --cert\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --cert certfile --key keyfile\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--cert-type\n,\n--key\nand\n--key-type\n.\n--cert-status\n(TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server\ncertificate by using the Certificate Status Request (aka.\nOCSP stapling) TLS extension.\nIf this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid\n(e.g. expired) response, if the response suggests that the\nserver certificate has been revoked, or no response at all\nis received, the verification fails.\nThis is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL and\nGnuTLS backends.\nProviding\n--cert-status\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-cert-status.\nExample:\ncurl --cert-status\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--pinnedpubkey\n.\n--cert-type <type>\n(TLS) Tells curl what type the provided client certificate\nis using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.\nThe default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually\nPEM, however for Secure Transport and Schannel it is P12.\nIf\n-E, --cert\nis a pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default\ntype.\nIf\n--cert-type\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --cert-type PEM --cert file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-E, --cert\n,\n--key\nand\n--key-type\n.\n--ciphers <list of ciphers>\n(TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The\nlist of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL\ncipher list details on this URL:\nhttps://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html\nIf\n--ciphers\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--tlsv1.3\n,\n--tls13-ciphers\nand\n--proxy-ciphers\n.\n--compressed\n(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the\nalgorithms curl supports, and automatically decompress the\ncontent.\nResponse headers are not modified when saved, so if they\nare \"interpreted\" separately again at a later point they\nmight appear to be saying that the content is (still)\ncompressed; while in fact it has already been decompressed.\nIf this option is used and the server sends an unsupported\nencoding, curl reports an error. This is a request, not an\norder; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.\nProviding\n--compressed\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-compressed.\nExample:\ncurl --compressed\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--compressed-ssh\n.\n--compressed-ssh\n(SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a\nrequest, not an order; the server may or may not do it.\nProviding\n--compressed-ssh\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-compressed-ssh.\nExample:\ncurl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--compressed\n. Added in 7.56.0.\n-K, --config <file>\nSpecify a text file to read curl arguments from. The\ncommand line arguments found in the text file are used as\nif they were provided on the command line.\nOptions and their parameters must be specified on the same\nline in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the\nequals sign. Long option names can optionally be given in\nthe config file without the initial double dashes and if\nso, the colon or equals characters can be used as\nseparators. If the option is specified with one or two\ndashes, there can be no colon or equals character between\nthe option and its parameter.\nIf the parameter contains whitespace or starts with a colon\n(:) or equals sign (=), it must be specified enclosed\nwithin double quotes (\"). Within double quotes the\nfollowing escape sequences are available: \\\\, \\\", \\t, \\n,\n\\r and \\v. A backslash preceding any other letter is\nignored.\nIf the first non-blank column of a config line is a '#'\ncharacter, that line is treated as a comment.\nOnly write one option per physical line in the config file.\nA single line is required to be no more than 10 megabytes\n(since 8.2.0).\nSpecify the filename to\n-K, --config\nas '-' to make curl\nread the file from stdin.\nNote that to be able to specify a URL in the config file,\nyou need to specify it using the\n--url\noption, and not by\nsimply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look\nsimilar to this:\nurl = \"https://curl.se/docs/\"\n# --- Example file ---\n# this is a comment\nurl = \"example.com\"\noutput = \"curlhere.html\"\nuser-agent = \"superagent/1.0\"\n# and fetch another URL too\nurl = \"example.com/docs/manpage.html\"\n-O\nreferer = \"http://nowhereatall.example.com/\"\n# --- End of example file ---\nWhen curl is invoked, it (unless\n-q, --disable\nis used)\nchecks for a default config file and uses it if found, even\nwhen\n-K, --config\nis used. The default config file is\nchecked for in the following places in this order:\n1)\n\"$CURL_HOME/.curlrc\"\n2)\n\"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/curlrc\"\n(Added in 7.73.0)\n3)\n\"$HOME/.curlrc\"\n4) Windows:\n\"%USERPROFILE%\\.curlrc\"\n5) Windows:\n\"%APPDATA%\\.curlrc\"\n6) Windows: \"%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\.curlrc\"\n7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory\n8) On Windows, if it finds no\n.curlrc\nfile in the sequence\ndescribed above, it checks for one in the same dir the curl\nexecutable is placed.\nOn Windows two filenames are checked per location:\n.curlrc\nand\n_curlrc\n, preferring the former. Older versions on\nWindows checked for\n_curlrc\nonly.\n-K, --config\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --config file.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-q, --disable\n.\n--connect-timeout <fractional seconds>\nMaximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection to\ntake.  This only limits the connection phase, so if curl\nconnects within the given period it continues - if not it\nexits.\nThis option accepts decimal values. The decimal value needs\nto be provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not\nthe local version even if it might be using another\nseparator.\nThe connection phase is considered complete when the DNS\nlookup and requested TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.\nIf\n--connect-timeout\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExamples:\ncurl --connect-timeout 20\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --connect-timeout 3.14\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-m, --max-time\n.\n--connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>\nFor a request to the given HOST1:PORT1 pair, connect to\nHOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct\nrequests at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster\nnode in a cluster of servers. This option is only used to\nestablish the network connection. It does NOT affect the\nhostname/port that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI,\ncertificate verification) or for the application protocols.\n\"HOST1\" and \"PORT1\" may be the empty string, meaning \"any\nhost/port\". \"HOST2\" and \"PORT2\" may also be the empty\nstring, meaning \"use the request's original host/port\".\nA \"host\" specified to this option is compared as a string,\nso it needs to match the name used in request URL. It can\nbe either numerical such as \"127.0.0.1\" or the full host\nname such as \"example.org\".\n--connect-to\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--resolve\nand\n-H, --header\n.\n-C, --continue-at <offset>\nContinue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given\noffset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that\nare skipped, counting from the beginning of the source file\nbefore it is transferred to the destination. If used with\nuploads, the FTP server command SIZE is not used by curl.\nUse \"-C -\" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how\nto resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input\nfiles to figure that out.\nIf\n-C, --continue-at\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExamples:\ncurl -C -\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -C 400\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-r, --range\n.\n-b, --cookie <data|filename>\n(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie\nheader. It is supposedly the data previously received from\nthe server in a \"Set-Cookie:\" line. The data should be in\nthe format \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\". This makes curl\nuse the cookie header with this content explicitly in all\noutgoing request(s). If multiple requests are done due to\nauthentication, followed redirects or similar, they all get\nthis cookie passed on.\nIf no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead\ntreated as a filename to read previously stored cookie\nfrom. This option also activates the cookie engine which\nmakes curl record incoming cookies, which may be handy if\nyou are using this in combination with the\n-L, --location\noption or do multiple URL transfers on the same invoke. If\nthe file name is exactly a minus (\"-\"), curl instead reads\nthe contents from stdin.\nThe file format of the file to read cookies from should be\nplain HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the\nNetscape/Mozilla cookie file format.\nThe file specified with\n-b, --cookie\nis only used as input.\nNo cookies are written to the file. To store cookies, use\nthe\n-c, --cookie-jar\noption.\nIf you use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a\ndomain then the cookie is not sent since the domain never\nmatches. To address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line\n(doing that includes subdomains) or preferably: use the\nNetscape format.\nUsers often want to both read cookies from a file and write\nupdated cookies back to a file, so using both\n-b, --cookie\nand\n-c, --cookie-jar\nin the same command line is common.\n-b, --cookie\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl -b cookiefile\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-c, --cookie-jar\nand\n-j, --junk-session-cookies\n.\n-c, --cookie-jar <filename>\n(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all\ncookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all\ncookies from its in-memory cookie storage to the given file\nat the end of operations. If no cookies are known, no data\nis written. The file is created using the Netscape cookie\nfile format. If you set the file name to a single dash,\n\"-\", the cookies are written to stdout.\nThe file specified with\n-c, --cookie-jar\nis only used for\noutput. No cookies are read from the file. To read cookies,\nuse the\n-b, --cookie\noption. Both options can specify the\nsame file.\nThis command line option activates the cookie engine that\nmakes curl record and use cookies. The\n-b, --cookie\noption\nalso activates it.\nIf the cookie jar cannot be created or written to, the\nwhole curl operation does not fail or even report an error\nclearly. Using\n-v, --verbose\ngets a warning displayed, but\nthat is the only visible feedback you get about this\npossibly lethal situation.\nIf\n-c, --cookie-jar\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl -c store-here.txt\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -c store-here.txt -b read-these\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-b, --cookie\n.\n--create-dirs\nWhen used in conjunction with the\n-o, --output\noption, curl\ncreates the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed.\nThis option creates the directories mentioned with the\n-o,\n--output\noption combined with the path possibly set with\n--output-dir\n. If the combined output file name uses no\ndirectory, or if the directories it mentions already exist,\nno directories are created.\nCreated directories are made with mode 0750 on unix style\nfile systems.\nTo create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try\n--ftp-create-dirs\n.\nProviding\n--create-dirs\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-create-dirs.\nExample:\ncurl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--ftp-create-dirs\nand\n--output-dir\n.\n--create-file-mode <mode>\n(SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely\nusing one of the supported protocols, this option allows\nthe user to set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation\ntime, instead of the default 0644.\nThis option takes an octal number as argument.\nIf\n--create-file-mode\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new\nSee also\n--ftp-create-dirs\n. Added in 7.75.0.\n--crlf (FTP SMTP) Convert line feeds to carriage return plus line\nfeeds in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).\n(SMTP added in 7.40.0)\nProviding\n--crlf\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-crlf.\nExample:\ncurl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n-B, --use-ascii\n.\n--crlfile <file>\n(TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate\nRevocation List that may specify peer certificates that are\nto be considered revoked.\nIf\n--crlfile\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --crlfile rejects.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--cacert\nand\n--capath\n.\n--curves <algorithm list>\n(TLS) Tells curl to request specific curves to use during\nSSL session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.\nMultiple algorithms can be provided by separating them with\n\":\" (e.g.  \"X25519:P-521\").  The parameter is available\nidentically in the \"openssl s_client/s_server\" utilities.\n--curves\nallows a OpenSSL powered curl to make\nSSL-connections with exactly the (EC) curve requested by\nthe client, avoiding nontransparent client/server\nnegotiations.\nIf this option is set, the default curves list built into\nOpenSSL are ignored.\nIf\n--curves\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --curves X25519\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--ciphers\n. Added in 7.73.0.\n-d, --data <data>\n(HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST request to\nthe HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a\nuser has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit\nbutton. This makes curl pass the data to the server using\nthe content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare\nto\n-F, --form\n.\n--data-raw\nis almost the same but does not have a special\ninterpretation of the @ character. To post data purely\nbinary, you should instead use the\n--data-binary\noption. To\nURL-encode the value of a form field you may use\n--data-urlencode\n.\nIf any of these options is used more than once on the same\ncommand line, the data pieces specified are merged with a\nseparating &-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d\nskill=lousy' would generate a post chunk that looks like\n'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.\nIf you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be\na file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to\nread the data from stdin. Posting data from a file named\n'foobar' would thus be done with\n-d, --data\n@foobar. When\n-d, --data\nis told to read from a file like that, carriage\nreturns and newlines are stripped out. If you do not want\nthe @ character to have a special interpretation use\n--data-raw\ninstead.\nThe data for this option is passed on to the server exactly\nas provided on the command line. curl does not convert,\nchange or improve it. It is up to the user to provide the\ndata in the correct form.\n-d, --data\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl -d \"name=curl\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -d \"name=curl\" -d \"tool=cmdline\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -d @filename\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--data-binary\n,\n--data-urlencode\nand\n--data-raw\n.\nThis option is mutually exclusive to\n-F, --form\nand\n-I,\n--head\nand\n-T, --upload-file\n.\n--data-ascii <data>\n(HTTP) This is just an alias for\n-d, --data\n.\n--data-ascii\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --data-ascii @file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--data-binary\n,\n--data-raw\nand\n--data-urlencode\n.\n--data-binary <data>\n(HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra\nprocessing whatsoever.\nIf you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be\na filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as\n-d,\n--data\ndoes, except that newlines and carriage returns are\npreserved and conversions are never done.\nLike\n-d, --data\nthe default content-type sent to the server\nis application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the data\nto be treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then\nset the content-type to octet-stream: -H \"Content-Type:\napplication/octet-stream\".\nIf this option is used several times, the ones following\nthe first append data as described in\n-d, --data\n.\n--data-binary\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --data-binary @filename\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--data-ascii\n.\n--data-raw <data>\n(HTTP) This posts data similarly to\n-d, --data\nbut without\nthe special interpretation of the @ character.\n--data-raw\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl --data-raw \"hello\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --data-raw \"@at@at@\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-d, --data\n.\n--data-urlencode <data>\n(HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other\n-d, --data\noptions with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.\nTo be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin with a\nname\nfollowed by a separator and a content specification.\nThe <data> part can be passed to curl using one of the\nfollowing syntaxes:\ncontent\nThis makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that\non. Just be careful so that the content does not\ncontain any = or @ symbols, as that makes the syntax\nmatch one of the other cases below!\n=content\nThis makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that\non. The preceding = symbol is not included in the\ndata.\nname=content\nThis makes curl URL-encode the content part and pass\nthat on. Note that the name part is expected to be\nURL-encoded already.\n@filename\nThis makes curl load data from the given file\n(including any newlines), URL-encode that data and\npass it on in the POST.\nname@filename\nThis makes curl load data from the given file\n(including any newlines), URL-encode that data and\npass it on in the POST. The name part gets an equal\nsign appended, resulting in\nname=urlencoded-file-content\n. Note that the name is\nexpected to be URL-encoded already.\n--data-urlencode\ncan be used several times in a command\nline\nExamples:\ncurl --data-urlencode name=val\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --data-urlencode =encodethis\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --data-urlencode name@file\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --data-urlencode @fileonly\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-d, --data\nand\n--data-raw\n.\n--delegation <LEVEL>\n(GSS/kerberos) Set LEVEL to tell the server what it is\nallowed to delegate when it comes to user credentials.\nnone   Do not allow any delegation.\npolicy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is\nset in the Kerberos service ticket, which is a\nmatter of realm policy.\nalways Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.\nIf\n--delegation\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --delegation \"none\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-k, --insecure\nand\n--ssl\n.\n--digest\n(HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an\nauthentication scheme that prevents the password from being\nsent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination\nwith the normal\n-u, --user\noption to set user name and\npassword.\nProviding\n--digest\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-digest.\nExample:\ncurl -u name:password --digest\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-u, --user\n,\n--proxy-digest\nand\n--anyauth\n. This\noption is mutually exclusive to\n--basic\nand\n--ntlm\nand\n--negotiate\n.\n-q, --disable\nIf used as the\nfirst\nparameter on the command line, the\ncurlrc\nconfig file is not read or used. See the\n-K,\n--config\nfor details on the default config file search\npath.\nPrior to 7.50.0 curl supported the short option name\nq\nbut\nnot the long option name\ndisable\n.\nProviding\n-q, --disable\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-disable.\nExample:\ncurl -q\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-K, --config\n.\n--disable-eprt\n(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT\ncommands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl normally\nfirst attempts to use EPRT before using PORT, but with this\noption, it uses PORT right away. EPRT is an extension to\nthe original FTP protocol, and does not work on all\nservers, but enables more functionality in a better way\nthan the traditional PORT command.\n--eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and\n--no-eprt is an alias for\n--disable-eprt\n.\nIf the server is accessed using IPv6, this option has no\neffect as EPRT is necessary then.\nDisabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you\nwant to switch to passive mode you need to not use\n-P,\n--ftp-port\nor force it with\n--ftp-pasv\n.\nProviding\n--disable-eprt\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-disable-eprt.\nExample:\ncurl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--disable-epsv\nand\n-P, --ftp-port\n.\n--disable-epsv\n(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when\ndoing passive FTP transfers. Curl normally first attempts\nto use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it does not\ntry EPSV.\n--epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and\n--no-epsv is an alias for\n--disable-epsv\n.\nIf the server is an IPv6 host, this option has no effect as\nEPSV is necessary then.\nDisabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you\nwant to switch to active mode you need to use\n-P,\n--ftp-port\n.\nProviding\n--disable-epsv\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-disable-epsv.\nExample:\ncurl --disable-epsv ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--disable-eprt\nand\n-P, --ftp-port\n.\n--disallow-username-in-url\nThis tells curl to exit if passed a URL containing a\nusername. This is probably most useful when the URL is\nbeing provided at runtime or similar.\nProviding\n--disallow-username-in-url\nmultiple times has no\nextra effect.  Disable it again with\n--no-disallow-username-in-url.\nExample:\ncurl --disallow-username-in-url\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proto\n. Added in 7.61.0.\n--dns-interface <interface>\n(DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS requests through\n<interface>. This option is a counterpart to\n--interface\n(which does not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an\ninterface name (not an address).\nIf\n--dns-interface\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --dns-interface eth0\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--dns-ipv4-addr\nand\n--dns-ipv6-addr\n.\n--dns-interface\nrequires that the underlying libcurl was\nbuilt to support c-ares.\n--dns-ipv4-addr <address>\n(DNS) Tell curl to bind to a specific IP address when\nmaking IPv4 DNS requests, so that the DNS requests\noriginate from this address. The argument should be a\nsingle IPv4 address.\nIf\n--dns-ipv4-addr\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--dns-interface\nand\n--dns-ipv6-addr\n.\n--dns-ipv4-addr\nrequires that the underlying libcurl was\nbuilt to support c-ares.\n--dns-ipv6-addr <address>\n(DNS) Tell curl to bind to a specific IP address when\nmaking IPv6 DNS requests, so that the DNS requests\noriginate from this address. The argument should be a\nsingle IPv6 address.\nIf\n--dns-ipv6-addr\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --dns-ipv6-addr 2a04:4e42::561\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--dns-interface\nand\n--dns-ipv4-addr\n.\n--dns-ipv6-addr\nrequires that the underlying libcurl was\nbuilt to support c-ares.\n--dns-servers <addresses>\n(DNS) Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the\nsystem default.  The list of IP addresses should be\nseparated with commas. Port numbers may also optionally be\ngiven as\n:<port-number>\nafter each IP address.\nIf\n--dns-servers\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --dns-servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--dns-interface\nand\n--dns-ipv4-addr\n.\n--dns-servers\nrequires that the underlying libcurl was built to support\nc-ares.\n--doh-cert-status\nSame as\n--cert-status\nbut used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).\nProviding\n--doh-cert-status\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-doh-cert-status.\nExample:\ncurl --doh-cert-status --doh-url\nhttps://doh.example\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--doh-insecure\n. Added in 7.76.0.\n--doh-insecure\nSame as\n-k, --insecure\nbut used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).\nProviding\n--doh-insecure\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-doh-insecure.\nExample:\ncurl --doh-insecure --doh-url\nhttps://doh.example\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--doh-url\n. Added in 7.76.0.\n--doh-url <URL>\nSpecifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to use to\nresolve hostnames, instead of using the default name\nresolver mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS.\nSome SSL options that you set for your transfer also\napplies to DoH since the name lookups take place over SSL.\nHowever, the certificate verification settings are not\ninherited but are controlled separately via\n--doh-insecure\nand\n--doh-cert-status\n.\nThis option is unset if an empty string \"\" is used as the\nURL.  (Added in 7.85.0)\nIf\n--doh-url\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --doh-url\nhttps://doh.example\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--doh-insecure\n. Added in 7.62.0.\n-D, --dump-header <filename>\n(HTTP FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the\nspecified file. If no headers are received, the use of this\noption creates an empty file.\nWhen used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are\nconsidered being \"headers\" and thus are saved there.\nHaving multiple transfers in one set of operations (i.e.\nthe URLs in one\n-:, --next\nclause), appends them to the\nsame file, separated by a blank line.\nIf\n-D, --dump-header\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --dump-header store.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-o, --output\n.\n--egd-file <file>\n(TLS) Deprecated option (added in 7.84.0). Prior to that it\nonly had an effect on curl if built to use old versions of\nOpenSSL.\nSpecify the path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon\nsocket. The socket is used to seed the random engine for\nSSL connections.\nIf\n--egd-file\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --egd-file /random/here\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--random-file\n.\n--engine <name>\n(TLS) Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher\noperations. Use\n--engine\nlist to print a list of build-time\nsupported engines. Note that not all (and possibly none) of\nthe engines may be available at runtime.\nIf\n--engine\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --engine flavor\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--ciphers\nand\n--curves\n.\n--etag-compare <file>\n(HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the\nspecific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom\nIf-None-Match header using the stored ETag.\nFor correct results, make sure that the specified file\ncontains only a single line with the desired ETag. An empty\nfile is parsed as an empty ETag.\nUse the option\n--etag-save\nto first save the ETag from a\nresponse, and then use this option to compare against the\nsaved ETag in a subsequent request.\nIf\n--etag-compare\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --etag-compare etag.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--etag-save\nand\n-z, --time-cond\n. Added in 7.68.0.\n--etag-save <file>\n(HTTP) This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified\nfile. An ETag is a caching related header, usually returned\nin a response.\nIf no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.\nIf\n--etag-save\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --etag-save storetag.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--etag-compare\n. Added in 7.68.0.\n--expect100-timeout <seconds>\n(HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait\nfor a 100-continue response when curl emits an Expects:\n100-continue header in its request. By default curl waits\none second. This option accepts decimal values! When curl\nstops waiting, it continues as if the response has been\nreceived.\nThe decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as\ndecimal separator - not the local version even if it might\nbe using another separator.\nIf\n--expect100-timeout\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--connect-timeout\n.\n-f, --fail\n(HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors.\nThis is useful to enable scripts and users to better deal\nwith failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server\nfails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document\nstating so (which often also describes why and more). This\nflag prevents curl from outputting that and return error\n22.\nThis method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where\nnon-successful response codes slip through, especially when\nauthentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).\nProviding\n-f, --fail\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-fail.\nExample:\ncurl --fail\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--fail-with-body\nand\n--fail-early\n. This option is\nmutually exclusive to\n--fail-with-body\n.\n--fail-early\nFail and exit on the first detected transfer error.\nWhen curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command\nline, it attempts to operate on each given URL, one by one.\nBy default, it ignores errors if there are more URLs given\nand the last URL's success determines the error code curl\nreturns. So early failures are \"hidden\" by subsequent\nsuccessful transfers.\nUsing this option, curl instead returns an error on the\nfirst transfer that fails, independent of the amount of\nURLs that are given on the command line. This way, no\ntransfer failures go undetected by scripts and similar.\nThis option does not imply\n-f, --fail\n, which causes\ntransfers to fail due to the server's HTTP status code. You\ncan combine the two options, however note\n-f, --fail\nis not\nglobal and is therefore contained by\n-:, --next\n.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nProviding\n--fail-early\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-fail-early.\nExample:\ncurl --fail-early\nhttps://example.com\nhttps://two.example\nSee also\n-f, --fail\nand\n--fail-with-body\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n--fail-with-body\n(HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP\nresponse code is 400 or greater). In normal cases when an\nHTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML\ndocument stating so (which often also describes why and\nmore). This flag allows curl to output and save that\ncontent but also to return error 22.\nThis is an alternative option to\n-f, --fail\nwhich makes\ncurl fail for the same circumstances but without saving the\ncontent.\nProviding\n--fail-with-body\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.\nExample:\ncurl --fail-with-body\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-f, --fail\nand\n--fail-early\n. This option is\nmutually exclusive to\n-f, --fail\n. Added in 7.76.0.\n--false-start\n(TLS) Tells curl to use false start during the TLS\nhandshake. False start is a mode where a TLS client starts\nsending application data before verifying the server's\nFinished message, thus saving a round trip when performing\na full handshake.\nThis is currently only implemented in the Secure Transport\n(on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backend.\nProviding\n--false-start\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-false-start.\nExample:\ncurl --false-start\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--tcp-fastopen\n.\n-F, --form <name=content>\n(HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl\nemulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the\nsubmit button. This causes curl to POST data using the\nContent-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.\nFor SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a\nmultipart mail message to transmit.\nThis enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the\n'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @\nsign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the\nfile name with the symbol <. The difference between @ and <\nis then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a\nfile upload, while the < makes a text field and just get\nthe contents for that text field from a file.\nTell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by\nusing - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs.\nWhen stdin is used, the contents is buffered in memory\nfirst by curl to determine its size and allow a possible\nresend. Defining a part's data from a named non-regular\nfile (such as a named pipe or similar) is not subject to\nbuffering and is instead read at transmission time; since\nthe full size is unknown before the transfer starts, such\ndata is sent as chunks by HTTP and rejected by IMAP.\nExample: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile'\nis the name of the form-field to which the file\nportrait.jpg\nis the input:\ncurl -F profile=@portrait.jpg\nhttps://example.com/upload.cgi\nExample: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to\nthe server:\ncurl -F name=John -F shoesize=11\nhttps://example.com/\nExample: send your essay in a text field to the server.\nSend it as a plain text field, but get the contents for it\nfrom a local file:\ncurl -F \"story=<hugefile.txt\"\nhttps://example.com/\nYou can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using\n'type=', in a manner similar to:\ncurl -F \"web=@index.html;type=text/html\" example.com\nor\ncurl -F \"name=daniel;type=text/foo\" example.com\nYou can also explicitly change the name field of a file\nupload part by setting filename=, like this:\ncurl -F \"file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost\" example.com\nIf filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by\ndouble-quotes like:\ncurl -F \"file=@\\\"local,file\\\";filename=\\\"name;in;post\\\"\" example.com\nor\ncurl -F 'file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"' example.com\nNote that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes,\nany double-quote or backslash within the filename must be\nescaped by backslash.\nQuoting must also be applied to non-file data if it\ncontains semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading\ndouble quotes:\ncurl -F 'colors=\"red; green; blue\";type=text/x-myapp' example.com\nYou can add custom headers to the field by setting\nheaders=, like\ncurl -F \"submit=OK;headers=\\\"X-submit-type: OK\\\"\" example.com\nor\ncurl -F \"submit=OK;headers=@headerfile\" example.com\nThe headers= keyword may appear more that once and above\nnotes about quoting apply. When headers are read from a\nfile, Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments\nand ignored; each header can be folded by splitting between\ntwo words and starting the continuation line with a space;\nembedded carriage-returns and trailing spaces are stripped.\nHere is an example of a header file contents:\n# This file contain two headers.\nX-header-1: this is a header\n# The following header is folded.\nX-header-2: this is\nanother header\nTo support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is\nextended as follows:\n- name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first\ncharacter of the argument,\n- if data starts with '(', this signals to start a new\nmultipart: it can be followed by a content type\nspecification.\n- a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.\nExample: the following command sends an SMTP mime email\nconsisting in an inline part in two alternative formats:\nplain text and HTML. It attaches a text file:\ncurl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \\\n-F '=plain text message' \\\n-F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \\\n-F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com\nData can be encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available\nencodings are\nbinary\nand\n8bit\nthat do nothing else than\nadding the corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header,\n7bit\nthat only rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer\nerror,\nquoted-printable\nand\nbase64\nthat encodes data\naccording to the corresponding schemes, limiting lines\nlength to 76 characters.\nExample: send multipart mail with a quoted-printable text\nmessage and a base64 attached file:\ncurl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \\\n-F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com\nSee further examples and details in the MANUAL.\n-F, --form\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --form \"name=curl\" --form \"file=@loadthis\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-d, --data\n,\n--form-string\nand\n--form-escape\n. This\noption is mutually exclusive to\n-d, --data\nand\n-I, --head\nand\n-T, --upload-file\n.\n--form-escape\n(HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields\nand files using backslash-escaping instead of\npercent-encoding.\nIf\n--form-escape\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --form-escape -F 'field\\name=curl' -F 'file=@load\"this'\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-F, --form\n. Added in 7.81.0.\n--form-string <name=string>\n(HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to\n-F, --form\nexcept that the\nvalue string for the named parameter is used literally.\nLeading '@' and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in\nthe value have no special meaning. Use this in preference\nto\n-F, --form\nif there is any possibility that the string\nvalue may accidentally trigger the '@' or '<' features of\n-F, --form\n.\n--form-string\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --form-string \"data\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-F, --form\n.\n--ftp-account <data>\n(FTP) When an FTP server asks for \"account data\" after user\nname and password has been provided, this data is sent off\nusing the ACCT command.\nIf\n--ftp-account\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-account \"mr.robot\" ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n-u, --user\n.\n--ftp-alternative-to-user <command>\n(FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands\nfails, send this command.  When connecting to Tumbleweed's\nSecure Transport server over FTPS using a client\ncertificate, using \"SITE AUTH\" tells the server to retrieve\nthe username from the certificate.\nIf\n--ftp-alternative-to-user\nis provided several times, the\nlast set value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-alternative-to-user \"U53r\" ftp://example.com\nSee also\n--ftp-account\nand\n-u, --user\n.\n--ftp-create-dirs\n(FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path\nthat does not currently exist on the server, the standard\nbehavior of curl is to fail. Using this option, curl\ninstead attempts to create missing directories.\nProviding\n--ftp-create-dirs\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-ftp-create-dirs.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file\nSee also\n--create-dirs\n.\n--ftp-method <method>\n(FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file\non an FTP(S) server. The method argument should be one of\nthe following alternatives:\nmulticwd\ncurl does a single CWD operation for each path part\nin the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means\nmany commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should\nbe done. This is the default but the slowest\nbehavior.\nnocwd  curl does no CWD at all. curl does SIZE, RETR, STOR\netc and give a full path to the server for all these\ncommands. This is the fastest behavior.\nsinglecwd\ncurl does one CWD with the full target directory and\nthen operates on the file \"normally\" (like in the\nmulticwd case). This is somewhat more standards\ncompliant than 'nocwd' but without the full penalty\nof 'multicwd'.\nIf\n--ftp-method\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file\ncurl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file\ncurl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file\nSee also\n-l, --list-only\n.\n--ftp-pasv\n(FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is\nthe internal default behavior, but using this option can be\nused to override a previous\n-P, --ftp-port\noption.\nReversing an enforced passive really is not doable but you\nmust then instead enforce the correct\n-P, --ftp-port\nagain.\nPassive mode means that curl tries the EPSV command first\nand then PASV, unless\n--disable-epsv\nis used.\nProviding\n--ftp-pasv\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-ftp-pasv.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--disable-epsv\n.\n-P, --ftp-port <address>\n(FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when\nconnecting with FTP. This option makes curl use active\nmode. curl then tells the server to connect back to the\nclient's specified address and port, while passive mode\nasks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to\nconnect to. <address> should be one of:\ninterface\ne.g. \"eth0\" to specify which interface's IP address\nyou want to use (Unix only)\nIP address\ne.g. \"192.168.10.1\" to specify the exact IP address\nhost name\ne.g. \"my.host.domain\" to specify the machine\n-      make curl pick the same IP address that is already\nused for the control connection\nDisable the use of PORT with\n--ftp-pasv\n. Disable the\nattempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using\n--disable-eprt\n. EPRT is really PORT++.\nYou can also append \":[start]-[end]\" to the right of the\naddress, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That\nmeans you specify a port range, from a lower to a higher\nnumber. A single number works as well, but do note that it\nincreases the risk of failure since the port may not be\navailable.\nIf\n-P, --ftp-port\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl -P - ftp:/example.com\ncurl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com\ncurl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com\nSee also\n--ftp-pasv\nand\n--disable-eprt\n.\n--ftp-pret\n(FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and\nEPSV). Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd, require this\nnon-standard command for directory listings as well as up\nand downloads in PASV mode.\nProviding\n--ftp-pret\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-ftp-pret.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n-P, --ftp-port\nand\n--ftp-pasv\n.\n--ftp-skip-pasv-ip\n(FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server\nsuggests in its response to curl's PASV command when curl\nconnects the data connection. Instead curl reuses the same\nIP address it already uses for the control connection.\nThis option is enabled by default (added in 7.74.0).\nThis option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used\ninstead of PASV.\nProviding\n--ftp-skip-pasv-ip\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-skip-pasv-ip ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--ftp-pasv\n.\n--ftp-ssl-ccc\n(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Shuts down the\nSSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The rest of the control\nchannel communication is be unencrypted. This allows NAT\nrouters to follow the FTP transaction. The default mode is\npassive.\nProviding\n--ftp-ssl-ccc\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/\nSee also\n--ssl\nand\n--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode\n.\n--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode <active/passive>\n(FTP) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode does not initiate\nthe shutdown, but instead waits for the server to do it,\nand does not reply to the shutdown from the server. The\nactive mode initiates the shutdown and waits for a reply\nfrom the server.\nProviding\n--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode active --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/\nSee also\n--ftp-ssl-ccc\n.\n--ftp-ssl-control\n(FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP login, clear for\ntransfer.  Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted\ndata transfers for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the\nserver does not support SSL/TLS.\nProviding\n--ftp-ssl-control\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-control.\nExample:\ncurl --ftp-ssl-control ftp://example.com\nSee also\n--ssl\n.\n-G, --get\n(HTTP) When used, this option makes all data specified with\n-d, --data\n,\n--data-binary\nor\n--data-urlencode\nto be used in\nan HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that\notherwise would be used. The data is appended to the URL\nwith a '?' separator.\nIf used in combination with\n-I, --head\n, the POST data is\ninstead appended to the URL with a HEAD request.\nProviding\n-G, --get\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-get.\nExamples:\ncurl --get\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --get -d \"tool=curl\" -d \"age=old\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --get -I -d \"tool=curl\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-d, --data\nand\n-X, --request\n.\n-g, --globoff\nThis option switches off the \"URL globbing parser\". When\nyou set this option, you can specify URLs that contain the\nletters {}[] without having curl itself interpret them.\nNote that these letters are not normal legal URL contents\nbut they should be encoded according to the URI standard.\nProviding\n-g, --globoff\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-globoff.\nExample:\ncurl -g \"https://example.com/{[]}}}}\"\nSee also\n-K, --config\nand\n-q, --disable\n.\n--happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms <milliseconds>\nHappy Eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to\nboth IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for dual-stack hosts, giving\nIPv6 a head-start of the specified number of milliseconds.\nIf the IPv6 address cannot be connected to within that\ntime, then a connection attempt is made to the IPv4 address\nin parallel. The first connection to be established is the\none that is used.\nThe range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy\nEyeballs RFC 6555 says \"It is RECOMMENDED that connection\nattempts be paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors\nagainst network load.\" libcurl currently defaults to 200\nms. Firefox and Chrome currently default to 300 ms.\nIf\n--happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms\nis provided several times,\nthe last set value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms 500\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-m, --max-time\nand\n--connect-timeout\n. Added in\n7.59.0.\n--haproxy-clientip\n(HTTP) Sets a client IP in HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header\nat the beginning of the connection.\nFor valid requests, IPv4 addresses must be indicated as a\nseries of exactly 4 integers in the range [0..255]\ninclusive written in decimal representation separated by\nexactly one dot between each other. Heading zeroes are not\npermitted in front of numbers in order to avoid any\npossible confusion with octal numbers. IPv6 addresses must\nbe indicated as series of 4 hexadecimal digits (upper or\nlower case) delimited by colons between each other, with\nthe acceptance of one double colon sequence to replace the\nlargest acceptable range of consecutive zeroes. The total\nnumber of decoded bits must exactly be 128.\nOtherwise, any string can be accepted for the client IP and\nget sent.\nIt replaces\n--haproxy-protocol\nif used, it is not necessary\nto specify both flags.\nThis option is primarily useful when sending test requests\nto verify a service is working as intended.\nIf\n--haproxy-clientip\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --haproxy-clientip $IP\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n. Added in 8.2.0.\n--haproxy-protocol\n(HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the\nbeginning of the connection. This is used by some load\nbalancers and reverse proxies to indicate the client's true\nIP address and port.\nThis option is primarily useful when sending test requests\nto a service that expects this header.\nProviding\n--haproxy-protocol\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-haproxy-protocol.\nExample:\ncurl --haproxy-protocol\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n. Added in 7.60.0.\n-I, --head\n(HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers\nfeature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but\nthe header of a document. When used on an FTP or FILE file,\ncurl displays the file size and last modification time\nonly.\nProviding\n-I, --head\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-head.\nExample:\ncurl -I\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-G, --get\n,\n-v, --verbose\nand\n--trace-ascii\n.\n-H, --header <header/@file>\n(HTTP IMAP SMTP) Extra header to include in information\nsent. When used within an HTTP request, it is added to the\nregular request headers.\nFor an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with\n-F,\n--form\noptions, it is prepended to the resulting MIME\ndocument, effectively including it at the mail global\nlevel. It does not affect raw uploaded mails (Added in\n7.56.0).\nYou may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if\nyou should add a custom header that has the same name as\none of the internal ones curl would use, your externally\nset header is used instead of the internal one. This allows\nyou to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally\ndo. You should not replace internally set headers without\nknowing perfectly well what you are doing. Remove an\ninternal header by giving a replacement without content on\nthe right side of the colon, as in: -H \"Host:\". If you send\nthe custom header with no-value then its header must be\nterminated with a semicolon, such as -H \"X-Custom-Header;\"\nto send \"X-Custom-Header:\".\ncurl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent\nwith the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus\nnot\nadd\nthat as a part of the header content: do not add newlines\nor carriage returns, they only mess things up for you. curl\npasses on the verbatim string you give it without any\nfilter or other safe guards. That includes white space and\ncontrol characters.\nThis option can take an argument in @filename style, which\nthen adds a header for each line in the input file. Using\n@- makes curl read the header file from stdin. Added in\n7.55.0.\nPlease note that most anti-spam utilities check the\npresence and value of several MIME mail headers: these are\n\"From:\", \"To:\", \"Date:\" and \"Subject:\" among others and\nshould be added with this option.\nYou need\n--proxy-header\nto send custom headers intended for\nan HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.\nPassing on a \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" header when doing\nan HTTP request with a request body, makes curl send the\ndata using chunked encoding.\nWARNING\n: headers set with this option are set in all HTTP\nrequests - even after redirects are followed, like when\ntold with\n-L, --location\n. This can lead to the header being\nsent to other hosts than the original host, so sensitive\nheaders should be used with caution combined with following\nredirects.\n-H, --header\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl -H \"X-First-Name: Joe\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -H \"User-Agent: yes-please/2000\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -H \"Host:\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -H @headers.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-A, --user-agent\nand\n-e, --referer\n.\n-h, --help <category>\nUsage help. This lists all curl command line options within\nthe given\ncategory\n.\nIf no argument is provided, curl displays only the most\nimportant command line arguments.\nFor category\nall\n, curl displays help for all options.\nIf\ncategory\nis specified, curl displays all available help\ncategories.\nExample:\ncurl --help all\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\n.\n--hostpubmd5 <md5>\n(SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits.\nThe string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote\nhost's public key, curl refuses the connection with the\nhost unless the md5sums match.\nIf\n--hostpubmd5\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--hostpubsha256\n.\n--hostpubsha256 <sha256>\n(SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing a Base64-encoded SHA256\nhash of the remote host's public key. Curl refuses the\nconnection with the host unless the hashes match.\nThis feature requires libcurl to be built with libssh2 and\ndoes not work with other SSH backends.\nIf\n--hostpubsha256\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --hostpubsha256 NDVkMTQxMGQ1ODdmMjQ3MjczYjAyOTY5MmRkMjVmNDQ= sftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--hostpubmd5\n. Added in 7.80.0.\n--hsts <file name>\n(HTTPS) This option enables HSTS for the transfer. If the\nfile name points to an existing HSTS cache file, that is\nused. After a completed transfer, the cache is saved to the\nfile name again if it has been modified.\nIf curl is told to use HTTP:// for a transfer involving a\nhost name that exists in the HSTS cache, it upgrades the\ntransfer to use HTTPS. Each HSTS cache entry has an\nindividual life time after which the upgrade is no longer\nperformed.\nSpecify a \"\" file name (zero length) to avoid\nloading/saving and make curl just handle HSTS in memory.\nIf this option is used several times, curl loads contents\nfrom all the files but the last one is used for saving.\n--hsts\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --hsts cache.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proto\n. Added in 7.74.0.\n--http0.9\n(HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9\nresponse.\nHTTP/0.9 is a response without headers and therefore you\ncan also connect with this to non-HTTP servers and still\nget a response since curl simply transparently downgrades -\nif allowed.\nHTTP/0.9 is disabled by default (added in 7.66.0)\nProviding\n--http0.9\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-http0.9.\nExample:\ncurl --http0.9\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http1.1\n,\n--http2\nand\n--http3\n. Added in 7.64.0.\n-0, --http1.0\n(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using\nits internally preferred HTTP version.\nProviding\n-0, --http1.0\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --http1.0\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http0.9\nand\n--http1.1\n. This option is mutually\nexclusive to\n--http1.1\nand\n--http2\nand\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nand\n--http3\n.\n--http1.1\n(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.\nProviding\n--http1.1\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --http1.1\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-0, --http1.0\nand\n--http0.9\n. This option is\nmutually exclusive to\n-0, --http1.0\nand\n--http2\nand\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nand\n--http3\n.\n--http2\n(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.\nFor HTTPS, this means curl negotiates HTTP/2 in the TLS\nhandshake. curl does this by default.\nFor HTTP, this means curl attempts to upgrade the request\nto HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request header.\nWhen curl uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself insist\non TLS 1.2 or higher even though that is required by the\nspecification. A user can add this version requirement with\n--tlsv1.2\n.\nProviding\n--http2\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --http2\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http1.1\n,\n--http3\nand\n--no-alpn\n.\n--http2\nrequires\nthat the underlying libcurl was built to support HTTP/2.\nThis option is mutually exclusive to\n--http1.1\nand\n-0,\n--http1.0\nand\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nand\n--http3\n.\n--http2-prior-knowledge\n(HTTP) Tells curl to issue its non-TLS HTTP requests using\nHTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade. It requires prior\nknowledge that the server supports HTTP/2 straight away.\nHTTPS requests still do HTTP/2 the standard way with\nnegotiated protocol version in the TLS handshake.\nProviding\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nmultiple times has no\nextra effect.  Disable it again with\n--no-http2-prior-knowledge.\nExample:\ncurl --http2-prior-knowledge\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http2\nand\n--http3\n.\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nrequires that the underlying libcurl was built to support\nHTTP/2. This option is mutually exclusive to\n--http1.1\nand\n-0, --http1.0\nand\n--http2\nand\n--http3\n.\n--http3\n(HTTP) Tells curl to try HTTP/3 to the host in the URL, but\nfallback to earlier HTTP versions if the HTTP/3 connection\nestablishment fails. HTTP/3 is only available for HTTPS and\nnot for HTTP URLs.\nThis option allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc method\nof upgrading to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks\nHTTP/3 on the given host and port.\nWhen asked to use HTTP/3, curl issues a separate attempt to\nuse older HTTP versions with a slight delay, so if the\nHTTP/3 transfer fails or is slow, curl still tries to\nproceed with an older HTTP version.\nUse\n--http3-only\nfor similar functionality\nwithout\na\nfallback.\nProviding\n--http3\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --http3\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http1.1\nand\n--http2\n.\n--http3\nrequires that the\nunderlying libcurl was built to support HTTP/3. This option\nis mutually exclusive to\n--http1.1\nand\n-0, --http1.0\nand\n--http2\nand\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nand\n--http3-only\n. Added\nin 7.66.0.\n--http3-only\n(HTTP) Instructs curl to use HTTP/3 to the host in the URL,\nwith no fallback to earlier HTTP versions. HTTP/3 can only\nbe used for HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs. For HTTP, this\noption triggers an error.\nThis option allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc method\nof upgrading to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks\nHTTP/3 on the given host and port.\nThis option makes curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be\nestablished, it does not attempt any other HTTP versions on\nits own. Use\n--http3\nfor similar functionality\nwith\na\nfallback.\nProviding\n--http3-only\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --http3-only\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http1.1\n,\n--http2\nand\n--http3\n.\n--http3-only\nrequires that the underlying libcurl was built to support\nHTTP/3. This option is mutually exclusive to\n--http1.1\nand\n-0, --http1.0\nand\n--http2\nand\n--http2-prior-knowledge\nand\n--http3\n. Added in 7.88.0.\n--ignore-content-length\n(FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header. This\nis particularly useful for servers running Apache 1.x,\nwhich reports incorrect Content-Length for files larger\nthan 2 gigabytes.\nFor FTP, this makes curl skip the SIZE command to figure\nout the size before downloading a file.\nThis option does not work for HTTP if libcurl was built to\nuse hyper.\nProviding\n--ignore-content-length\nmultiple times has no\nextra effect.  Disable it again with\n--no-ignore-content-length.\nExample:\ncurl --ignore-content-length\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--ftp-skip-pasv-ip\n.\n-i, --include\n(HTTP FTP) Include response headers in the output. HTTP\nresponse headers can include things like server name,\ncookies, date of the document, HTTP version and more...\nWith non-HTTP protocols, the \"headers\" are other server\ncommunication.\nTo view the request headers, consider the\n-v, --verbose\noption.\nPrior to 7.75.0 curl did not print the headers if\n-f,\n--fail\nwas used in combination with this option and there\nwas error reported by server.\nProviding\n-i, --include\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-include.\nExample:\ncurl -i\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\n.\n-k, --insecure\n(TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl\nmakes is verified to be secure before the transfer takes\nplace. This option makes curl skip the verification step\nand proceed without checking.\nWhen this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl\nverifies the server's TLS certificate before it continues:\nthat the certificate contains the right name which matches\nthe host name used in the URL and that the certificate has\nbeen signed by a CA certificate present in the cert store.\nSee this online resource for further details:\nhttps://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html\nFor SFTP and SCP, this option makes curl skip the\nknown_hosts\nverification.\nknown_hosts\nis a file normally\nstored in the user's home directory in the \".ssh\"\nsubdirectory, which contains host names and their public\nkeys.\nWARNING\n: using this option makes the transfer insecure.\nWhen curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses and\nallows for example HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be\nstored and used subsequently. Using\n-k, --insecure\ncan make\ncurl trust and use such information from malicious servers.\nProviding\n-k, --insecure\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-insecure.\nExample:\ncurl --insecure\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-insecure\n,\n--cacert\nand\n--capath\n.\n--interface <name>\nPerform an operation using a specified interface. You can\nenter interface name, IP address or host name. An example\ncould look like:\ncurl --interface eth0:1\nhttps://www.example.com/\nOn Linux it can be used to specify a\nVRF\n, but the binary\nneeds to either have\nCAP_NET_RAW\nor to be run as root. More\ninformation about Linux\nVRF\n:\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt\nIf\n--interface\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --interface eth0\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--dns-interface\n.\n--ipfs-gateway <URL>\n(IPFS) Specify which gateway to use for IPFS and IPNS URLs.\nNot specifying this will instead make curl check if the\nIPFS_GATEWAY environment variable is set, or if a\n~/.ipfs/gateway file holding the gateway URL exists.\nIf you run a local IPFS node, this gateway is by default\navailable under\nhttp://localhost:8080\n. A full example URL\nwould look like:\ncurl --ipfs-gateway\nhttp://localhost:8080\nipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\nThere are many public IPFS gateways. See for example:\nhttps://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/\nWARNING: If you opt to go for a remote gateway you should\nbe aware that you completely trust the gateway. This is\nfine in local gateways as you host it yourself. With remote\ngateways there could potentially be a malicious actor\nreturning you data that does not match the request you\nmade, inspect or even interfere with the request. You will\nnot notice this when using curl. A mitigation could be to\ngo for a \"trustless\" gateway. This means you locally verify\nthat the data. Consult the docs page on trusted vs\ntrustless:\nhttps://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trusted-vs-trustless\nIf\n--ipfs-gateway\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --ipfs-gateway\nhttps://example.com\nipfs://\nSee also\n-h, --help\nand\n-M, --manual\n. Added in 8.4.0.\n-4, --ipv4\nThis option tells curl to use IPv4 addresses only when\nresolving host names, and not for example try IPv6.\nProviding\n-4, --ipv4\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --ipv4\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http1.1\nand\n--http2\n. This option is mutually\nexclusive to\n-6, --ipv6\n.\n-6, --ipv6\nThis option tells curl to use IPv6 addresses only when\nresolving host names, and not for example try IPv4.\nProviding\n-6, --ipv6\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --ipv6\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--http1.1\nand\n--http2\n. This option is mutually\nexclusive to\n-4, --ipv4\n.\n--json <data>\n(HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST request to\nthe HTTP server.\n--json\nworks as a shortcut for passing on\nthese three options:\n--data [arg]\n--header \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n--header \"Accept: application/json\"\nThere is no verification that the passed in data is actual\nJSON or that the syntax is correct.\nIf you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be\na file name to read the data from, or a single dash (-) if\nyou want curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data\nfrom a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with\n--json\n@foobar and to instead read the data from stdin, use\n--json\n@-.\nIf this option is used more than once on the same command\nline, the additional data pieces are concatenated to the\nprevious before sending.\nThe headers this option sets can be overridden with\n-H,\n--header\nas usual.\n--json\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl --json '{ \"drink\": \"coffe\" }'\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --json '{ \"drink\":' --json ' \"coffe\" }'\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --json @prepared\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --json @-\nhttps://example.com\n< json.txt\nSee also\n--data-binary\nand\n--data-raw\n. This option is\nmutually exclusive to\n-F, --form\nand\n-I, --head\nand\n-T,\n--upload-file\n. Added in 7.82.0.\n-j, --junk-session-cookies\n(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file,\nthis option makes it discard all \"session cookies\". This\nhas the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical\nbrowsers discard session cookies when they are closed down.\nProviding\n-j, --junk-session-cookies\nmultiple times has no\nextra effect.  Disable it again with\n--no-junk-session-cookies.\nExample:\ncurl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-b, --cookie\nand\n-c, --cookie-jar\n.\n--keepalive-time <seconds>\nThis option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle\nbefore sending keepalive probes and the time between\nindividual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on\noperating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and\nTCP_KEEPINTVL socket options (meaning Linux, recent AIX,\nHP-UX and more).  Keepalives are used by the TCP stack to\ndetect broken networks on idle connections. The number of\nmissed keepalive probes before declaring the connection\ndown is OS dependent and is commonly 9 or 10. This option\nhas no effect if\n--no-keepalive\nis used.\nIf unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.\nIf\n--keepalive-time\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --keepalive-time 20\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--no-keepalive\nand\n-m, --max-time\n.\n--key <key>\n(TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your\nprivate key in this separate file. For SSH, if not\nspecified, curl tries the following candidates in order:\n'~/.ssh/id_rsa', '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.\nIf curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine\npkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be\nused to specify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device.\nA string beginning with \"pkcs11:\" is interpreted as a\nPKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the\n--engine\noption is set as \"pkcs11\" if none was provided and\nthe\n--key-type\noption is set as \"ENG\" if none was provided.\nIf curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then\nthis option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc).\nThose backends expect the private key to be already present\nin the keychain or PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.\nIf\n--key\nis provided several times, the last set value is\nused.\nExample:\ncurl --cert certificate --key here\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--key-type\nand\n-E, --cert\n.\n--key-type <type>\n(TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your\n--key\nprovided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported.\nIf not specified, PEM is assumed.\nIf\n--key-type\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --key-type DER --key here\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--key\n.\n--krb <level>\n(FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level\nmust be entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe',\n'confidential', or 'private'. Should you use a level that\nis not one of these, 'private' is used.\nIf\n--krb\nis provided several times, the last set value is\nused.\nExample:\ncurl --krb clear ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--delegation\nand\n--ssl\n.\n--krb\nrequires that the\nunderlying libcurl was built to support Kerberos.\n--libcurl <file>\nAppend this option to any ordinary curl command line, and\nyou get libcurl-using C source code written to the file\nthat does the equivalent of what your command-line\noperation does!\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nIf\n--libcurl\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --libcurl client.c\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\n.\n--limit-rate <speed>\nSpecify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use -\nfor both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if\nyou have a limited pipe and you would like your transfer\nnot to use your entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it\notherwise would be.\nThe given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a\nsuffix is appended.  Appending 'k' or 'K' counts the number\nas kilobytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or\n'G' makes it gigabytes. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are\n1024 based. For example 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and\n1G.\nThe rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer\nspeed to no more than the set threshold over a period of\nmultiple seconds.\nIf you also use the\n-Y, --speed-limit\noption, that option\ntakes precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting\nslightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working.\nIf\n--limit-rate\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl --limit-rate 100K\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --limit-rate 1000\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --limit-rate 10M\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--rate\n,\n-Y, --speed-limit\nand\n-y, --speed-time\n.\n-l, --list-only\n(FTP POP3 SFTP) (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this\nswitch forces a name-only view. This is especially useful\nif the user wants to machine-parse the contents of an FTP\ndirectory since the normal directory view does not use a\nstandard look or format. When used like this, the option\ncauses an NLST command to be sent to the server instead of\nLIST.\nNote: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to\nNLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic\nlinks.\n(SFTP) When listing an SFTP directory, this switch forces a\nname-only view, one per line.  This is especially useful if\nthe user wants to machine-parse the contents of an SFTP\ndirectory since the normal directory view provides more\ninformation than just file names.\n(POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this\nswitch forces a LIST command to be performed instead of\nRETR. This is particularly useful if the user wants to see\nif a specific message-id exists on the server and what size\nit is.\nNote: When combined with\n-X, --request\n, this option can be\nused to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use\nthe email's unique identifier rather than its message-id to\nmake the request.\nProviding\n-l, --list-only\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-list-only.\nExample:\ncurl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/\nSee also\n-Q, --quote\nand\n-X, --request\n.\n--local-port <num/range>\nSet a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local\nport numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port\nnumbers by nature are a scarce resource so setting this\nrange to something too narrow might cause unnecessary\nconnection setup failures.\nIf\n--local-port\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --local-port 1000-3000\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-g, --globoff\n.\n-L, --location\n(HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has\nmoved to a different location (indicated with a Location:\nheader and a 3XX response code), this option makes curl\nredo the request on the new place. If used together with\n-i, --include\nor\n-I, --head\n, headers from all requested\npages are shown.\nWhen authentication is used, curl only sends its\ncredentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl\nto a different host, it does not get the user+password pass\non. See also\n--location-trusted\non how to change this.\nLimit the amount of redirects to follow by using the\n--max-redirs\noption.\nWhen curl follows a redirect and if the request is a POST,\nit sends the following request with a GET if the HTTP\nresponse was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was any\nother 3xx code, curl resends the following request using\nthe same unmodified method.\nYou can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after\na 30x response by using the dedicated options for that:\n--post301\n,\n--post302\nand\n--post303\n.\nThe method set with\n-X, --request\noverrides the method curl\nwould otherwise select to use.\nProviding\n-L, --location\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-location.\nExample:\ncurl -L\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--resolve\nand\n--alt-svc\n.\n--location-trusted\n(HTTP) Like\n-L, --location\n, but allows sending the name +\npassword to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This\nmay or may not introduce a security breach if the site\nredirects you to a site to which you send your\nauthentication info (which is plaintext in the case of HTTP\nBasic authentication).\nProviding\n--location-trusted\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-location-trusted.\nExample:\ncurl --location-trusted -u user:password\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-u, --user\n.\n--login-options <options>\n(IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options to use\nduring server authentication.\nYou can use login options to specify protocol specific\noptions that may be used during authentication. At present\nonly IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more\ninformation about login options please see RFC 2384, RFC\n5092 and the IETF draft\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-earhart-url-smtp-00\n.\nSince 8.2.0, IMAP supports the login option \"AUTH=+LOGIN\".\nWith this option, curl uses the plain (not SASL) LOGIN IMAP\ncommand even if the server advertises SASL authentication.\nCare should be taken in using this option, as it sends your\npassword over the network in plain text. This does not work\nif the IMAP server disables the plain LOGIN (e.g. to\nprevent password snooping).\nIf\n--login-options\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com\nSee also\n-u, --user\n.\n--mail-auth <address>\n(SMTP) Specify a single address. This is used to specify\nthe authentication address (identity) of a submitted\nmessage that is being relayed to another server.\nIf\n--mail-auth\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/\nSee also\n--mail-rcpt\nand\n--mail-from\n.\n--mail-from <address>\n(SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should\nget sent from.\nIf\n--mail-from\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/\nSee also\n--mail-rcpt\nand\n--mail-auth\n.\n--mail-rcpt <address>\n(SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or mailing\nlist name. Repeat this option several times to send to\nmultiple recipients.\nWhen performing an address verification (\nVRFY\ncommand), the\nrecipient should be specified as the user name or user name\nand domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC 5321).\nWhen performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the\nrecipient should be specified using the mailing list name,\nsuch as \"Friends\" or \"London-Office\".\n--mail-rcpt\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com\nSee also\n--mail-rcpt-allowfails\n.\n--mail-rcpt-allowfails\n(SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default\ncurl aborts SMTP conversation if at least one of the\nrecipients causes RCPT TO command to return an error.\nThe default behavior can be changed by passing\n--mail-rcpt-allowfails\ncommand-line option which makes curl\nignore errors and proceed with the remaining valid\nrecipients.\nIf all recipients trigger RCPT TO failures and this flag is\nspecified, curl still aborts the SMTP conversation and\nreturns the error received from to the last RCPT TO\ncommand.\nProviding\n--mail-rcpt-allowfails\nmultiple times has no\nextra effect.  Disable it again with\n--no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.\nExample:\ncurl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com\nSee also\n--mail-rcpt\n. Added in 7.69.0.\n-M, --manual\nManual. Display the huge help text.\nExample:\ncurl --manual\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\n,\n--libcurl\nand\n--trace\n.\n--max-filesize <bytes>\n(FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a\nfile to download. If the file requested is larger than this\nvalue, the transfer does not start and curl returns with\nexit code 63.\nA size modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or\n'K' counts the number as kilobytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it\nmegabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples:\n200K, 3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)\nNOTE\n: before curl 8.4.0, when the file size is not known\nprior to download, for such files this option has no effect\neven if the file transfer ends up being larger than this\ngiven limit.\nStarting with curl 8.4.0, this option aborts the transfer\nif it reaches the threshold during transfer.\nIf\n--max-filesize\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --max-filesize 100K\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--limit-rate\n.\n--max-redirs <num>\n(HTTP) Set maximum number of redirections to follow. When\n-L, --location\nis used, to prevent curl from following too\nmany redirects, by default, the limit is set to 50\nredirects. Set this option to -1 to make it unlimited.\nIf\n--max-redirs\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --max-redirs 3 --location\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-L, --location\n.\n-m, --max-time <fractional seconds>\nMaximum time in seconds that you allow each transfer to\ntake.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from\nhanging for hours due to slow networks or links going down.\nThis option accepts decimal values.\nIf you enable retrying the transfer (\n--retry\n) then the\nmaximum time counter is reset each time the transfer is\nretried. You can use\n--retry-max-time\nto limit the retry\ntime.\nThe decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as\ndecimal separator - not the local version even if it might\nbe using another separator.\nIf\n-m, --max-time\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl --max-time 10\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --max-time 2.92\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--connect-timeout\nand\n--retry-max-time\n.\n--metalink\nThis option was previously used to specify a Metalink\nresource. Metalink support is disabled in curl for security\nreasons (added in 7.78.0).\nIf\n--metalink\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --metalink file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-Z, --parallel\n.\n--negotiate\n(HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.\nThis option requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI\nsupport. Use\n-V, --version\nto see if your curl supports\nGSS-API/SSPI or SPNEGO.\nWhen using this option, you must also provide a fake\n-u,\n--user\noption to activate the authentication code properly.\nSending a '-u :' is enough as the user name and password\nfrom the\n-u, --user\noption are not actually used.\nProviding\n--negotiate\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --negotiate -u :\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--basic\n,\n--ntlm\n,\n--anyauth\nand\n--proxy-negotiate\n.\n-n, --netrc\nMakes curl scan the\n.netrc\nfile in the user's home\ndirectory for login name and password. This is typically\nused for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl enables user\nauthentication. See\nnetrc\n(5) and\nftp\n(1) for details on the\nfile format. Curl does not complain if that file does not\nhave the right permissions (it should be neither world- nor\ngroup-readable). The environment variable \"HOME\" is used to\nfind the home directory.\nOn Windows two filenames in the home directory are checked:\n.netrc\nand\n_netrc\n, preferring the former. Older versions on\nWindows checked for\n_netrc\nonly.\nA quick and simple example of how to setup a\n.netrc\nto\nallow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user\nname 'myself' and password 'secret' could look similar to:\nmachine host.domain.com\nlogin myself\npassword secret\nProviding\n-n, --netrc\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-netrc.\nExample:\ncurl --netrc\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--netrc-file\n,\n-K, --config\nand\n-u, --user\n. This\noption is mutually exclusive to\n--netrc-file\nand\n--netrc-optional\n.\n--netrc-file <filename>\nThis option is similar to\n-n, --netrc\n, except that you\nprovide the path (absolute or relative) to the netrc file\nthat curl should use. You can only specify one netrc file\nper invocation.\nIt abides by\n--netrc-optional\nif specified.\nIf\n--netrc-file\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --netrc-file netrc\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-n, --netrc\n,\n-u, --user\nand\n-K, --config\n. This\noption is mutually exclusive to\n-n, --netrc\n.\n--netrc-optional\nSimilar to\n-n, --netrc\n, but this option makes the .netrc\nusage\noptional\nand not mandatory as the\n-n, --netrc\noption\ndoes.\nProviding\n--netrc-optional\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-netrc-optional.\nExample:\ncurl --netrc-optional\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--netrc-file\n. This option is mutually exclusive to\n-n, --netrc\n.\n-:, --next\nTells curl to use a separate operation for the following\nURL and associated options. This allows you to send several\nURL requests, each with their own specific options, for\nexample, such as different user names or custom requests\nfor each.\n-:, --next\nresets all local options and only global ones\nhave their values survive over to the operation following\nthe\n-:, --next\ninstruction. Global options include\n-v,\n--verbose\n,\n--trace\n,\n--trace-ascii\nand\n--fail-early\n.\nFor example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a single\ncommand line:\ncurl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com\n-:, --next\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl\nhttps://example.com\n--next -d postthis www2.example.com\ncurl -I\nhttps://example.com\n--next\nhttps://example.net/\nSee also\n-Z, --parallel\nand\n-K, --config\n.\n--no-alpn\n(HTTPS) Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by\ndefault if libcurl was built with an SSL library that\nsupports ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports\nHTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2 support with the server during\nhttps sessions.\nNote that this is the negated option name documented. You\ncan use --alpn to enable ALPN.\nProviding\n--no-alpn\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --alpn.\nExample:\ncurl --no-alpn\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--no-npn\nand\n--http2\n.\n--no-alpn\nrequires that the\nunderlying libcurl was built to support TLS.\n-N, --no-buffer\nDisables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work\nsituations, curl uses a standard buffered output stream\nthat has the effect that it outputs the data in chunks, not\nnecessarily exactly when the data arrives. Using this\noption disables that buffering.\nNote that this is the negated option name documented. You\ncan use --buffer to enable buffering again.\nProviding\n-N, --no-buffer\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --buffer.\nExample:\ncurl --no-buffer\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-#, --progress-bar\n.\n--no-clobber\nWhen used in conjunction with the\n-o, --output\n,\n-J,\n--remote-header-name\n,\n-O, --remote-name\n, or\n--remote-name-all\noptions, curl avoids overwriting files\nthat already exist. Instead, a dot and a number gets\nappended to the name of the file that would be created, up\nto filename.100 after which it does not create any file.\nNote that this is the negated option name documented.  You\ncan thus use --clobber to enforce the clobbering, even if\n-J, --remote-header-name\nis specified.\nProviding\n--no-clobber\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --clobber.\nExample:\ncurl --no-clobber --output local/dir/file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-o, --output\nand\n-O, --remote-name\n. Added in\n7.83.0.\n--no-keepalive\nDisables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP\nconnection. curl otherwise enables them by default.\nNote that this is the negated option name documented. You\ncan thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.\nProviding\n--no-keepalive\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --keepalive.\nExample:\ncurl --no-keepalive\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--keepalive-time\n.\n--no-npn\n(HTTPS) curl never uses NPN, this option has no effect\n(added in 7.86.0).\nDisable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default if\nlibcurl was built with an SSL library that supports NPN.\nNPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate\nHTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.\nProviding\n--no-npn\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --npn.\nExample:\ncurl --no-npn\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--no-alpn\nand\n--http2\n.\n--no-npn\nrequires that the\nunderlying libcurl was built to support TLS.\n--no-progress-meter\nOption to switch off the progress meter output without\nmuting or otherwise affecting warning and informational\nmessages like\n-s, --silent\ndoes.\nNote that this is the negated option name documented. You\ncan thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter\nagain.\nProviding\n--no-progress-meter\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --progress-meter.\nExample:\ncurl --no-progress-meter -o store\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\nand\n-s, --silent\n. Added in 7.67.0.\n--no-sessionid\n(TLS) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching. By\ndefault all transfers are done using the cache. Note that\nwhile nothing should ever get hurt by attempting to reuse\nSSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL\nimplementations in the wild that may require you to disable\nthis in order for you to succeed.\nNote that this is the negated option name documented. You\ncan thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.\nProviding\n--no-sessionid\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --sessionid.\nExample:\ncurl --no-sessionid\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-k, --insecure\n.\n--noproxy <no-proxy-list>\nComma-separated list of hosts for which not to use a proxy,\nif one is specified. The only wildcard is a single *\ncharacter, which matches all hosts, and effectively\ndisables the proxy. Each name in this list is matched as\neither a domain which contains the hostname, or the\nhostname itself. For example, local.com would match\nlocal.com, local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not\nwww.notlocal.com.\nThis option overrides the environment variables that\ndisable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY') (added in\n7.53.0). If there is an environment variable disabling a\nproxy, you can set the no proxy list to \"\" to override it.\nIP addresses specified to this option can be provided using\nCIDR notation (added in 7.86.0): an appended slash and\nnumber specifies the number of \"network bits\" out of the\naddress to use in the comparison. For example\n\"192.168.0.0/16\" would match all addresses starting with\n\"192.168\".\nIf\n--noproxy\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --noproxy \"www.example\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n.\n--ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication\nmethod was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web\nservers. It is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered\nby clever people and implemented in curl based on their\nefforts. This kind of behavior should not be endorsed, you\nshould encourage everyone who uses NTLM to switch to a\npublic and documented authentication method instead, such\nas Digest.\nIf you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication,\nthen use\n--proxy-ntlm\n.\nProviding\n--ntlm\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --ntlm -u user:password\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-ntlm\n.\n--ntlm\nrequires that the underlying\nlibcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mutually\nexclusive to\n--basic\nand\n--negotiate\nand\n--digest\nand\n--anyauth\n.\n--ntlm-wb\n(HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style\n--ntlm\ndoes, but hand\nover the authentication to the separate binary ntlmauth\napplication that is executed when needed.\nProviding\n--ntlm-wb\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --ntlm-wb -u user:password\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--ntlm\nand\n--proxy-ntlm\n.\n--oauth2-bearer <token>\n(IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer Token for\nOAUTH 2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token is used\nin conjunction with the user name which can be specified as\npart of the\n--url\nor\n-u, --user\noptions.\nThe Bearer Token and user name are formatted according to\nRFC 6750.\nIf\n--oauth2-bearer\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --oauth2-bearer \"mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--basic\n,\n--ntlm\nand\n--digest\n.\n-o, --output <file>\nWrite output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using\n{} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the\nURL and you can use '#' followed by a number in the <file>\nspecifier. That variable is replaced with the current\nstring for the URL being fetched. Like in:\ncurl \"http://{one,two}.example.com\" -o \"file_#1.txt\"\nor use several variables like:\ncurl \"http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example\" -o \"#1_#2\"\nYou may use this option as many times as the number of URLs\nyou have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the same\ncommand line, you can use it like this:\ncurl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net\nand the order of the -o options and the URLs does not\nmatter, just that the first -o is for the first URL and so\non, so the above command line can also be written as\ncurl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb\nSee also the\n--create-dirs\noption to create the local\ndirectories dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a\nsingle dash) passes the output to stdout.\nTo suppress response bodies, you can redirect output to\n/dev/null:\ncurl example.com -o /dev/null\nOr for Windows:\ncurl example.com -o nul\n-o, --output\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl -o file\nhttps://example.com\ncurl \"http://{one,two}.example.com\" -o \"file_#1.txt\"\ncurl \"http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example\" -o \"#1_#2\"\ncurl -o file\nhttps://example.com\n-o file2\nhttps://example.net\nSee also\n-O, --remote-name\n,\n--remote-name-all\nand\n-J,\n--remote-header-name\n.\n--output-dir <dir>\nThis option specifies the directory in which files should\nbe stored, when\n-O, --remote-name\nor\n-o, --output\nare used.\nThe given output directory is used for all URLs and output\noptions on the command line, up until the first\n-:, --next\n.\nIf the specified target directory does not exist, the\noperation fails unless\n--create-dirs\nis also used.\nIf\n--output-dir\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --output-dir \"tmp\" -O\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-O, --remote-name\nand\n-J, --remote-header-name\n.\nAdded in 7.73.0.\n-Z, --parallel\nMakes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to\nthe regular serial manner.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nProviding\n-Z, --parallel\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-parallel.\nExample:\ncurl --parallel\nhttps://example.com\n-o file1\nhttps://example.com\n-o file2\nSee also\n-:, --next\nand\n-v, --verbose\n. Added in 7.66.0.\n--parallel-immediate\nWhen doing parallel transfers, this option instructs curl\nthat it should rather prefer opening up more connections in\nparallel at once rather than waiting to see if new\ntransfers can be added as multiplexed streams on another\nconnection.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nProviding\n--parallel-immediate\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-parallel-immediate.\nExample:\ncurl --parallel-immediate -Z\nhttps://example.com\n-o file1\nhttps://example.com\n-o file2\nSee also\n-Z, --parallel\nand\n--parallel-max\n. Added in\n7.68.0.\n--parallel-max <num>\nWhen asked to do parallel transfers, using\n-Z, --parallel\n,\nthis option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do\nsimultaneously.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of\n-:, --next\n.\nThe default is 50.\nIf\n--parallel-max\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --parallel-max 100 -Z\nhttps://example.com\nftp://example.com/\nSee also\n-Z, --parallel\n. Added in 7.66.0.\n--pass <phrase>\n(SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.\nIf\n--pass\nis provided several times, the last set value is\nused.\nExample:\ncurl --pass secret --key file\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--key\nand\n-u, --user\n.\n--path-as-is\nTell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./ in the\ngiven URL path. Normally curl squashes or merges them\naccording to standards but with this option set you tell it\nnot to do that.\nProviding\n--path-as-is\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-path-as-is.\nExample:\ncurl --path-as-is\nhttps://example.com/../../etc/passwd\nSee also\n--request-target\n.\n--pinnedpubkey <hashes>\n(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified public key file (or\nhashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a file\nwhich contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or\nany number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by\n'sha256//' and separated by ';'.\nWhen negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends\na certificate indicating its identity. A public key is\nextracted from this certificate and if it does not exactly\nmatch the public key provided to this option, curl aborts\nthe connection before sending or receiving any data.\nThis option is independent of option\n-k, --insecure\n. If you\nuse both options together then the peer is still verified\nby public key.\nPEM/DER support:\nOpenSSL and GnuTLS, wolfSSL (added in 7.43.0), mbedTLS ,\nSecure Transport macOS 10.7+/iOS 10+ (7.54.1), Schannel\n(7.58.1)\nsha256 support:\nOpenSSL, GnuTLS and wolfSSL, mbedTLS (added in 7.47.0),\nSecure Transport macOS 10.7+/iOS 10+ (7.54.1), Schannel\n(7.58.1)\nOther SSL backends not supported.\nIf\n--pinnedpubkey\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl --pinnedpubkey keyfile\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc'\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--hostpubsha256\n.\n--post301\n(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert\nPOST requests into GET requests when following a 301\nredirection. The non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web\nbrowsers, so curl does the conversion by default to\nmaintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST\nto remain a POST after such a redirection. This option is\nmeaningful only when using\n-L, --location\n.\nProviding\n--post301\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-post301.\nExample:\ncurl --post301 --location -d \"data\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--post302\n,\n--post303\nand\n-L, --location\n.\n--post302\n(HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert\nPOST requests into GET requests when following a 302\nredirection. The non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web\nbrowsers, so curl does the conversion by default to\nmaintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST\nto remain a POST after such a redirection. This option is\nmeaningful only when using\n-L, --location\n.\nProviding\n--post302\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-post302.\nExample:\ncurl --post302 --location -d \"data\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--post301\n,\n--post303\nand\n-L, --location\n.\n--post303\n(HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert\nPOST requests into GET requests when following 303\nredirections. A server may require a POST to remain a POST\nafter a 303 redirection. This option is meaningful only\nwhen using\n-L, --location\n.\nProviding\n--post303\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-post303.\nExample:\ncurl --post303 --location -d \"data\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--post302\n,\n--post301\nand\n-L, --location\n.\n--preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]\nUse the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to an HTTP\nor HTTPS\n-x, --proxy\n. In such a case curl first connects to\nthe SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the\nHTTP or HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.\nThe pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol://\nprefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. Use\nsocks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request\nthe specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol\nspecified makes curl default to SOCKS4.\nIf the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it\nis assumed to be 1080.\nUser and password that might be provided in the proxy\nstring are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in\nspecial characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a\ncolon with %3a.\nIf\n--preproxy\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x\nhttp://http.example\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\nand\n--socks5\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n-#, --progress-bar\nMake curl display transfer progress as a simple progress\nbar instead of the standard, more informational, meter.\nThis progress bar draws a single line of '#' characters\nacross the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer\nsize is known. For transfers without a known size, there is\na space ship (-=o=-) that moves back and forth but only\nwhile data is being transferred, with a set of flying hash\nsign symbols on top.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nProviding\n-#, --progress-bar\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-progress-bar.\nExample:\ncurl -# -O\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--styled-output\n.\n--proto <protocols>\nTells curl to limit what protocols it may use for\ntransfers. Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma\nseparated, and are each a protocol name or 'all',\noptionally prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available\nmodifiers are:\n+      Permit this protocol in addition to protocols\nalready permitted (this is the default if no\nmodifier is used).\n-      Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of\nprotocols already permitted.\n=      Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already\npermitted), though subject to later modification by\nsubsequent entries in the comma separated list.\nFor example:\n--proto\n-ftps uses the default protocols, but\ndisables ftps\n--proto\n-all,https,+http only enables http and https\n--proto\n=http,https also only enables http and https\nUnknown and disabled protocols produce a warning. This\nallows scripts to safely rely on being able to disable\npotentially dangerous protocols, without relying upon\nsupport for that protocol being built into curl to avoid an\nerror.\nThis option can be used multiple times, in which case the\neffect is the same as concatenating the protocols into one\ninstance of the option.\nIf\n--proto\nis provided several times, the last set value is\nused.\nExample:\ncurl --proto =http,https,sftp\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proto-redir\nand\n--proto-default\n.\n--proto-default <protocol>\nTells curl to use\nprotocol\nfor any URL missing a scheme\nname.\nAn unknown or unsupported protocol causes error\nCURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL\n(1).\nThis option does not change the default proxy protocol\n(http).\nWithout this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the\nhost name, see\n--url\nfor details.\nIf\n--proto-default\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proto-default https ftp.example.com\nSee also\n--proto\nand\n--proto-redir\n.\n--proto-redir <protocols>\nTells curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect.\nProtocols denied by\n--proto\nare not overridden by this\noption. See\n--proto\nfor how protocols are represented.\nExample, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:\ncurl --proto-redir -all,http,https\nhttp://example.com\nBy default curl only allows HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on\nredirects (added in 7.65.2). Specifying\nall\nor\n+all\nenables\nall protocols on redirects, which is not good for security.\nIf\n--proto-redir\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proto-redir =http,https\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proto\n.\n-x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]\nUse the specified proxy.\nThe proxy string can be specified with a protocol://\nprefix. No protocol specified or\nhttp://\nit is treated as\nan HTTP proxy. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or\nsocks5h:// to request a specific SOCKS version to be used.\nUnix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set\nlocalhost for the host part. e.g.\nsocks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock\nHTTPS proxy support works set with the\nhttps://\nprotocol\nprefix for OpenSSL and GnuTLS (added in 7.52.0). It also\nworks for BearSSL, mbedTLS, rustls, Schannel, Secure\nTransport and wolfSSL (added in 7.87.0).\nUnrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an error\n(added in 7.52.0).  Ancient curl versions ignored unknown\nschemes and used\nhttp://\ninstead.\nIf the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it\nis assumed to be 1080.\nThis option overrides existing environment variables that\nset the proxy to use. If there is an environment variable\nsetting a proxy, you can set proxy to \"\" to override it.\nAll operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy are\ntransparently converted to HTTP. It means that certain\nprotocol specific operations might not be available. This\nis not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one\nwith the\n-p, --proxytunnel\noption.\nUser and password that might be provided in the proxy\nstring are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in\nspecial characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a\ncolon with %3a.\nThe proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy\nenvironment variables, including the protocol prefix\n(\nhttp://\n) and the embedded user + password.\nWhen a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with\n-P,\n--ftp-port\n, cannot be used.\nIf\n-x, --proxy\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy\nhttp://proxy.example\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--socks5\nand\n--proxy-basic\n.\n--proxy-anyauth\nTells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when\ncommunicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might cause\nan extra request/response round-trip.\nProviding\n--proxy-anyauth\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n,\n--proxy-basic\nand\n--proxy-digest\n.\n--proxy-basic\nTells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when\ncommunicating with the given proxy. Use\n--basic\nfor\nenabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is the\ndefault authentication method curl uses with proxies.\nProviding\n--proxy-basic\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n,\n--proxy-anyauth\nand\n--proxy-digest\n.\n--proxy-ca-native\n(TLS) Tells curl to use the CA store from the native\noperating system to verify the HTTPS proxy. By default,\ncurl uses a CA store provided in a single file or\ndirectory, but when using this option it interfaces the\noperating system's own vault.\nThis option only works for curl on Windows when built to\nuse OpenSSL. When curl on Windows is built to use Schannel,\nthis feature is implied and curl then only uses the native\nCA store.\ncurl built with wolfSSL also supports this option (added in\n8.3.0).\nProviding\n--proxy-ca-native\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-proxy-ca-native.\nExample:\ncurl --ca-native\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--cacert\n,\n--capath\nand\n-k, --insecure\n. Added in\n8.2.0.\n--proxy-cacert <file>\nSame as\n--cacert\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nIf\n--proxy-cacert\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-capath\n,\n--cacert\n,\n--capath\nand\n-x,\n--proxy\n.

Added in\n7.52.0.\n--proxy-cert <cert[:passwd]>\nSame as\n-E, --cert\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nIf\n--proxy-cert\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-cert file -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-cert-type\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n--proxy-cert-type <type>\nSame as\n--cert-type\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nIf\n--proxy-cert-type\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-cert-type PEM --proxy-cert file -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-cert\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n--proxy-ciphers <list>\nSame as\n--ciphers\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nSpecifies which ciphers to use in the connection to the\nHTTPS proxy. The list of ciphers must specify valid\nciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this URL:\nhttps://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html\nIf\n--proxy-ciphers\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--ciphers\n,\n--curves\nand\n-x, --proxy\n.

Added in 7.52.0.\n--proxy-digest\nTells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when\ncommunicating with the given proxy. Use\n--digest\nfor\nenabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.\nProviding\n--proxy-digest\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n,\n--proxy-anyauth\nand\n--proxy-basic\n.\n--proxy-header <header/@file>\n(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending\nHTTP to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra\nheaders. This is the equivalent option to\n-H, --header\nbut\nis for proxy communication only like in CONNECT requests\nwhen you want a separate header sent to the proxy to what\nis sent to the actual remote host.\ncurl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent\nwith the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus\nnot\nadd\nthat as a part of the header content: do not add newlines\nor carriage returns, they only mess things up for you.\nHeaders specified with this option are not included in\nrequests that curl knows are not be sent to a proxy.\nThis option can take an argument in @filename style, which\nthen adds a header for each line in the input file (added\nin 7.55.0). Using @- makes curl read the headers from\nstdin.\nThis option can be used multiple times to\nadd/replace/remove multiple headers.\n--proxy-header\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl --proxy-header \"X-First-Name: Joe\" -x\nhttp://proxy\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --proxy-header \"User-Agent: surprise\" -x\nhttp://proxy\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --proxy-header \"Host:\" -x\nhttp://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n.\n--proxy-http2\n(HTTP) Tells curl to try negotiate HTTP version 2 with an\nHTTPS proxy. The proxy might still only offer HTTP/1 and\nthen curl sticks to using that version.\nThis has no effect for any other kinds of proxies.\nProviding\n--proxy-http2\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-proxy-http2.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-http2 -x proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n.\n--proxy-http2\nrequires that the\nunderlying libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. Added in\n8.1.0.\n--proxy-insecure\nSame as\n-k, --insecure\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nProviding\n--proxy-insecure\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.

If you are using a different\nSSL backend you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by\nusing the\n--proxy-ciphers\noption.\nIf\n--proxy-tls13-ciphers\nis provided several times, the\nlast set value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--tls13-ciphers\n,\n--curves\nand\n--proxy-ciphers\n.\nAdded in 7.61.0.\n--proxy-tlsauthtype <type>\nSame as\n--tlsauthtype\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nIf\n--proxy-tlsauthtype\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-tlsauthtype SRP -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\nand\n--proxy-tlsuser\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n--proxy-tlspassword <string>\nSame as\n--tlspassword\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nIf\n--proxy-tlspassword\nis provided several times, the last\nset value is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-tlspassword passwd -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\nand\n--proxy-tlsuser\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n--proxy-tlsuser <name>\nSame as\n--tlsuser\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nIf\n--proxy-tlsuser\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-tlsuser smith -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\nand\n--proxy-tlspassword\n. Added in\n7.52.0.\n--proxy-tlsv1\nSame as\n-1, --tlsv1\nbut used in HTTPS proxy context.\nProviding\n--proxy-tlsv1\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-tlsv1 -x\nhttps://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n-U, --proxy-user <user:password>\nSpecify the user name and password to use for proxy\nauthentication.\nIf you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either\nNegotiate or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to\nselect the user name and password from your environment by\nspecifying a single colon with this option: \"-U :\".\nOn systems where it works, curl hides the given option\nargument from process listings. This is not enough to\nprotect credentials from possibly getting seen by other\nusers on the same system as they still are visible for a\nmoment before cleared. Such sensitive data should be\nretrieved from a file instead or similar and never used in\nclear text in a command line.\nIf\n-U, --proxy-user\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--proxy-pass\n.\n--proxy1.0 <host[:port]>\nUse the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not\nspecified, it is assumed at port 1080.\nThe only difference between this and the HTTP proxy option\n-x, --proxy\n, is that attempts to use CONNECT through the\nproxy specifies an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default\nHTTP 1.1.\nProviding\n--proxy1.0\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nExample:\ncurl --proxy1.0 -x\nhttp://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n,\n--socks5\nand\n--preproxy\n.\n-p, --proxytunnel\nWhen an HTTP proxy is used\n-x, --proxy\n, this option makes\ncurl tunnel the traffic through the proxy. The tunnel\napproach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and\nrequires that the proxy allows direct connect to the remote\nport number curl wants to tunnel through to.\nTo suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set\nto output headers use\n--suppress-connect-headers\n.\nProviding\n-p, --proxytunnel\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-proxytunnel.\nExample:\ncurl --proxytunnel -x\nhttp://proxy\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-x, --proxy\n.\n--pubkey <key>\n(SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your\npublic key in this separate file.\ncurl attempts to automatically extract the public key from\nthe private key file, so passing this option is generally\nnot required. Note that this public key extraction requires\nlibcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8 or\nhigher that is itself linked against OpenSSL.\nIf\n--pubkey\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--pass\n.\n-Q, --quote <command>\n(FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or\nSFTP server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer\ntakes place (just after the initial\nPWD\ncommand in an FTP\ntransfer, to be exact). To make commands take place after a\nsuccessful transfer, prefix them with a dash '-'.\n(FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has changed\nthe working directory, just before the file transfer\ncommand(s), prefix the command with a '+'. This is not\nperformed when a directory listing is performed.\nYou may specify any number of commands.\nBy default curl stops at first failure. To make curl\ncontinue even if the command fails, prefix the command with\nan asterisk (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure\nfor one of the commands, the entire operation is aborted.\nYou must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959\ndefines to FTP servers, or one of the commands listed below\nto SFTP servers.\nSFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets\nSFTP quote commands itself before sending them to the\nserver. File names may be quoted shell-style to embed\nspaces or special characters. Following is the list of all\nsupported SFTP quote commands:\natime date file\nThe atime command sets the last access time of the\nfile named by the file operand. The <date\nexpression> can be all sorts of date strings, see\nthe\ncurl_getdate\n(3) man page for date expression\ndetails. (Added in 7.73.0)\nchgrp group file\nThe chgrp command sets the group ID of the file\nnamed by the file operand to the group ID specified\nby the group operand. The group operand is a decimal\ninteger group ID.\nchmod mode file\nThe chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the\nspecified file. The mode operand is an octal integer\nmode number.\nchown user file\nThe chown command sets the owner of the file named\nby the file operand to the user ID specified by the\nuser operand. The user operand is a decimal integer\nuser ID.\nln source_file target_file\nThe ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link\nat the target_file location pointing to the\nsource_file location.\nmkdir directory_name\nThe mkdir command creates the directory named by the\ndirectory_name operand.\nmtime date file\nThe mtime command sets the last modification time of\nthe file named by the file operand. The <date\nexpression> can be all sorts of date strings, see\nthe\ncurl_getdate\n(3) man page for date expression\ndetails. (Added in 7.73.0)\npwd    The pwd command returns the absolute path name of\nthe current working directory.\nrename source target\nThe rename command renames the file or directory\nnamed by the source operand to the destination path\nnamed by the target operand.\nrm file\nThe rm command removes the file specified by the\nfile operand.\nrmdir directory\nThe rmdir command removes the directory entry\nspecified by the directory operand, provided it is\nempty.\nsymlink source_file target_file\nSee ln.\n-Q, --quote\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --quote \"DELE file\" ftp://example.com/foo\nSee also\n-X, --request\n.\n--random-file <file>\nDeprecated option. This option is ignored (added in\n7.84.0). Prior to that it only had an effect on curl if\nbuilt to use old versions of OpenSSL.\nSpecify the path name to file containing random data. The\ndata may be used to seed the random engine for SSL\nconnections.\nIf\n--random-file\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --random-file rubbish\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--egd-file\n.\n-r, --range <range>\n(HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial\ndocument) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP server or a local\nFILE. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.\n0-499  specifies the first 500 bytes\n500-999\nspecifies the second 500 bytes\n-500   specifies the last 500 bytes\n9500-  specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward\n0-0,-1 specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)\n100-199,500-599\nspecifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)\n(*) = NOTE that this causes the server to reply with a\nmultipart response, which is returned as-is by curl!\nParsing or otherwise transforming this response is the\nresponsibility of the caller.\nOnly digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and\n'stop' fields of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a\nnon-digit character is given in the range, the server's\nresponse is unspecified, depending on the server's\nconfiguration.\nMany HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so\nthat when you attempt to get a range, curl instead gets the\nwhole document.\nFTP and SFTP range downloads only support the simple\n'start-stop' syntax (optionally with one of the numbers\nomitted). FTP use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.\nIf\n-r, --range\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --range 22-44\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-C, --continue-at\nand\n-a, --append\n.\n--rate <max request rate>\nSpecify the maximum transfer frequency you allow curl to\nuse - in number of transfer starts per time unit (sometimes\ncalled request rate). Without this option, curl starts the\nnext transfer as fast as possible.\nIf given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than\nthe allowed rate, curl waits until the next transfer is\nstarted to maintain the requested rate. This option has no\neffect when\n-Z, --parallel\nis used.\nThe request rate is provided as \"N/U\" where N is an integer\nnumber and U is a time unit. Supported units are 's'\n(second), 'm' (minute), 'h' (hour) and 'd' /(day, as in a\n24 hour unit). The default time unit, if no \"/U\" is\nprovided, is number of transfers per hour.\nIf curl is told to allow 10 requests per minute, it does\nnot start the next request until 6 seconds have elapsed\nsince the previous transfer was started.\nThis function uses millisecond resolution. If the allowed\nfrequency is set more than 1000 per second, it instead runs\nunrestricted.\nWhen retrying transfers, enabled with\n--retry\n, the separate\nretry delay logic is used and not this setting.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nIf\n--rate\nis provided several times, the last set value is\nused.\nExamples:\ncurl --rate 2/s\nhttps://example.com\n...\ncurl --rate 3/h\nhttps://example.com\n...\ncurl --rate 14/m\nhttps://example.com\n...\nSee also\n--limit-rate\nand\n--retry-delay\n. Added in 7.84.0.\n--raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of\ncontent or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed\non unaltered, raw.\nProviding\n--raw\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-raw.\nExample:\ncurl --raw\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--tr-encoding\n.\n-e, --referer <URL>\n(HTTP) Sends the \"Referrer Page\" information to the HTTP\nserver. This can also be set with the\n-H, --header\nflag of\ncourse. When used with\n-L, --location\nyou can append\n\";auto\" to the\n-e, --referer\nURL to make curl automatically\nset the previous URL when it follows a Location: header.\nThe \";auto\" string can be used alone, even if you do not\nset an initial\n-e, --referer\n.\nIf\n-e, --referer\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl --referer \"https://fake.example\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --referer \"https://fake.example;auto\" -L\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --referer \";auto\" -L\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-A, --user-agent\nand\n-H, --header\n.\n-J, --remote-header-name\n(HTTP) This option tells the\n-O, --remote-name\noption to\nuse the server-specified Content-Disposition filename\ninstead of extracting a filename from the URL. If the\nserver-provided file name contains a path, that is stripped\noff before the file name is used.\nThe file is saved in the current directory, or in the\ndirectory specified with\n--output-dir\n.\nIf the server specifies a file name and a file with that\nname already exists in the destination directory, it is not\noverwritten and an error occurs - unless you allow it by\nusing the --clobber option. If the server does not specify\na file name then this option has no effect.\nThere is no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the\nprovided file name, so this option may provide you with\nrather unexpected file names.\nThis feature uses the name from the \"filename\" field, it\ndoes not yet support the \"filename*\" field (filenames with\nexplicit character sets).\nWARNING\n: Exercise judicious use of this option, especially\non Windows. A rogue server could send you the name of a DLL\nor other file that could be loaded automatically by Windows\nor some third party software.\nProviding\n-J, --remote-header-name\nmultiple times has no\nextra effect.  Disable it again with\n--no-remote-header-name.\nExample:\ncurl -OJ\nhttps://example.com/file\nSee also\n-O, --remote-name\n.\n-O, --remote-name\nWrite output to a local file named like the remote file we\nget. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the\npath is cut off.)\nThe file is saved in the current working directory. If you\nwant the file saved in a different directory, make sure you\nchange the current working directory before invoking curl\nwith this option or use\n--output-dir\n.\nThe remote file name to use for saving is extracted from\nthe given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it is\noverwritten. If you want the server to be able to choose\nthe file name refer to\n-J, --remote-header-name\nwhich can\nbe used in addition to this option. If the server chooses a\nfile name and that name already exists it is not\noverwritten.\nThere is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has\n%20 or other URL encoded parts of the name, they end up\nas-is as file name.\nYou may use this option as many times as the number of URLs\nyou have.\n-O, --remote-name\ncan be used several times in a command\nline\nExample:\ncurl -O\nhttps://example.com/filename\nSee also\n--remote-name-all\n,\n--output-dir\nand\n-J,\n--remote-header-name\n.\n--remote-name-all\nThis option changes the default action for all given URLs\nto be dealt with as if\n-O, --remote-name\nwere used for each\none. So if you want to disable that for a specific URL\nafter\n--remote-name-all\nhas been used, you must use \"-o -\"\nor --no-remote-name.\nProviding\n--remote-name-all\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-name-all.\nExample:\ncurl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2\nSee also\n-O, --remote-name\n.\n-R, --remote-time\nMakes curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the\nremote file that is getting downloaded, and if that is\navailable make the local file get that same timestamp.\nProviding\n-R, --remote-time\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-time.\nExample:\ncurl --remote-time -o foo\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-O, --remote-name\nand\n-z, --time-cond\n.\n--remove-on-error\nWhen curl returns an error when told to save output in a\nlocal file, this option removes that saved file before\nexiting. This prevents curl from leaving a partial file in\nthe case of an error during transfer.\nIf the output is not a file, this option has no effect.\nProviding\n--remove-on-error\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-remove-on-error.\nExample:\ncurl --remove-on-error -o output\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-f, --fail\n. Added in 7.83.0.\n-X, --request <method>\nChange the method to use when starting the transfer.\ncurl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the\nrequest without any filter or other safe guards. That\nincludes white space and control characters.\nHTTP   Specifies a custom request method to use when\ncommunicating with the HTTP server. The specified\nrequest method is used instead of the method\notherwise used (which defaults to\nGET\n). Read the\nHTTP 1.1 specification for details and explanations.\nCommon additional HTTP requests include\nPUT\nand\nDELETE\n, but related technologies like WebDAV offers\nPROPFIND\n,\nCOPY\n,\nMOVE\nand more.\nNormally you do not need this option. All sorts of\nGET\n,\nHEAD\n,\nPOST\nand\nPUT\nrequests are rather invoked\nby using dedicated command line options.\nThis option only changes the actual word used in the\nHTTP request, it does not alter the way curl\nbehaves. So for example if you want to make a proper\nHEAD request, using -X HEAD does not suffice. You\nneed to use the\n-I, --head\noption.\nThe method string you set with\n-X, --request\nis used\nfor all requests, which if you for example use\n-L,\n--location\nmay cause unintended side-effects when\ncurl does not change request method according to the\nHTTP 30x response codes - and similar.\nFTP    Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of\nLIST\nwhen doing file lists with FTP.\nPOP3   Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of\nLIST\nor\nRETR\n.\nIMAP   Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead of\nLIST\n.\nSMTP   Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of\nHELP\nor\nVRFY\n.\nIf\n-X, --request\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExamples:\ncurl -X \"DELETE\"\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -X NLST ftp://example.com/\nSee also\n--request-target\n.\n--request-target <path>\n(HTTP) Tells curl to use an alternative \"target\" (path)\ninstead of using the path as provided in the URL.\nParticularly useful when wanting to issue HTTP requests\nwithout leading slash or other data that does not follow\nthe regular URL pattern, like \"OPTIONS *\".\ncurl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the\nrequest without any filter or other safe guards. That\nincludes white space and control characters.\nIf\n--request-target\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --request-target \"*\" -X OPTIONS\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-X, --request\n. Added in 7.55.0.\n--resolve <[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...>\nProvide a custom address for a specific host and port pair.\nUsing this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a\nspecified address and prevent the otherwise normally\nresolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of\n/etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The\nport number should be the number used for the specific\nprotocol the host is used for. It means you need several\nentries if you want to provide address for the same host\nbut different ports.\nBy specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any\nhost and specific port pair to the specified address.\nWildcard is resolved last so any\n--resolve\nwith a specific\nhost and port is used first.\nThe provided address set by this option is used even if\n-4,\n--ipv4\nor\n-6, --ipv6\nis set to make curl use another IP\nversion.\nBy prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry\ntime out after curl's default timeout (1 minute). Note that\nthis only makes sense for long running parallel transfers\nwith a lot of files. In such cases, if this option is used\ncurl tries to resolve the host as it normally would once\nthe timeout has expired.\nSupport for providing the IP address within [brackets] was\nadded in 7.57.0.\nSupport for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was\nadded in 7.59.0.\nSupport for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.\nSupport for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.\n--resolve\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--connect-to\nand\n--alt-svc\n.\n--retry <num>\nIf a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform\na transfer, it retries this number of times before giving\nup. Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which\nis the default). Transient error means either: a timeout,\nan FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503\nor 504 response code.\nWhen curl is about to retry a transfer, it first waits one\nsecond and then for all forthcoming retries it doubles the\nwaiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then remains\ndelay between the rest of the retries. By using\n--retry-delay\nyou disable this exponential backoff\nalgorithm. See also\n--retry-max-time\nto limit the total\ntime allowed for retries.\ncurl complies with the Retry-After: response header if one\nwas present to know when to issue the next retry (added in\n7.66.0).\nIf\n--retry\nis provided several times, the last set value is\nused.\nExample:\ncurl --retry 7\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--retry-max-time\n.\n--retry-all-errors\nRetry on any error. This option is used together with\n--retry\n.\nThis option is the \"sledgehammer\" of retrying. Do not use\nthis option by default (for example in your\ncurlrc\n), there\nmay be unintended consequences such as sending or receiving\nduplicate data. Do not use with redirected input or output.\nYou'd be much better off handling your unique problems in\nshell script. Please read the example below.\nWARNING\n: For server compatibility curl attempts to retry\nfailed flaky transfers as close as possible to how they\nwere started, but this is not possible with redirected\ninput or output. For example, before retrying it removes\noutput data from a failed partial transfer that was written\nto an output file. However this is not true of data\nredirected to a | pipe or > file, which are not reset. We\nstrongly suggest you do not parse or record output via\nredirect in combination with this option, since you may\nreceive duplicate data.\nBy default curl does not return error for transfers with an\nHTTP response code that indicates an HTTP error, if the\ntransfer was successful. For example, if a server replies\n404 Not Found and the reply is fully received then that is\nnot an error. When\n--retry\nis used then curl retries on\nsome HTTP response codes that indicate transient HTTP\nerrors, but that does not include most 4xx response codes\nsuch as 404. If you want to retry on all response codes\nthat indicate HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) then combine with\n-f, --fail\n.\nProviding\n--retry-all-errors\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-retry-all-errors.\nExample:\ncurl --retry 5 --retry-all-errors\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--retry\n. Added in 7.71.0.\n--retry-connrefused\nIn addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED\nas a transient error too for\n--retry\n. This option is used\ntogether with\n--retry\n.\nProviding\n--retry-connrefused\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-retry-connrefused.\nExample:\ncurl --retry-connrefused --retry 7\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--retry\nand\n--retry-all-errors\n. Added in 7.52.0.\n--retry-delay <seconds>\nMake curl sleep this amount of time before each retry when\na transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes\nthe default backoff time algorithm between retries). This\noption is only interesting if\n--retry\nis also used. Setting\nthis delay to zero makes curl use the default backoff time.\nIf\n--retry-delay\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --retry-delay 5 --retry 7\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--retry\n.\n--retry-max-time <seconds>\nThe retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt.\nRetries are done as usual (see\n--retry\n) as long as the\ntimer has not reached this given limit. Notice that if the\ntimer has not reached the limit, the request is made and\nwhile performing, it may take longer than this given time\nperiod. To limit a single request's maximum time, use\n-m,\n--max-time\n. Set this option to zero to not timeout retries.\nIf\n--retry-max-time\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --retry-max-time 30 --retry 10\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--retry\n.\n--sasl-authzid <identity>\nUse this authorization identity (\nauthzid\n), during SASL\nPLAIN authentication, in addition to the authentication\nidentity (\nauthcid\n) as specified by\n-u, --user\n.\nIf the option is not specified, the server derives the\nauthzid\nfrom the\nauthcid\n, but if specified, and depending\non the server implementation, it may be used to access\nanother user's inbox, that the user has been granted access\nto, or a shared mailbox for example.\nIf\n--sasl-authzid\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --sasl-authzid zid imap://example.com/\nSee also\n--login-options\n. Added in 7.66.0.\n--sasl-ir\nEnable initial response in SASL authentication.\nProviding\n--sasl-ir\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-sasl-ir.\nExample:\ncurl --sasl-ir imap://example.com/\nSee also\n--sasl-authzid\n.\n--service-name <name>\nThis option allows you to change the service name for\nSPNEGO.\nIf\n--service-name\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl --service-name sockd/server\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--negotiate\nand\n--proxy-service-name\n.\n-S, --show-error\nWhen used with\n-s, --silent\n, it makes curl show an error\nmessage if it fails.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nProviding\n-S, --show-error\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-show-error.\nExample:\ncurl --show-error --silent\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--no-progress-meter\n.\n-s, --silent\nSilent or quiet mode. Do not show progress meter or error\nmessages. Makes Curl mute. It still outputs the data you\nask for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you\nredirect it.\nUse\n-S, --show-error\nin addition to this option to disable\nprogress meter but still show error messages.\nProviding\n-s, --silent\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-silent.\nExample:\ncurl -s\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\n,\n--stderr\nand\n--no-progress-meter\n.\n--socks4 <host[:port]>\nUse the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not\nspecified, it is assumed at port 1080. Using this socket\ntype make curl resolve the host name and passing the\naddress on to the proxy.\nTo specify proxy on a unix domain socket, use localhost for\nhost, e.g.  socks4://localhost/path/to/socket.sock\nThis option overrides any previous use of\n-x, --proxy\n, as\nthey are mutually exclusive.\nThis option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4\nproxy with\n-x, --proxy\nusing a socks4:// protocol prefix.\n--preproxy\ncan be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at the same\ntime proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy (added in\n7.52.0).

Alternately, the file name \".\" (a single\nperiod) may be specified instead of \"-\" to use stdin in\nnon-blocking mode to allow reading server output while\nstdin is being uploaded.\nIf this option is used with a HTTP(S) URL, the PUT method\nis used.\nYou can specify one\n-T, --upload-file\nfor each URL on the\ncommand line. Each\n-T, --upload-file\n+ URL pair specifies\nwhat to upload and to where. curl also supports \"globbing\"\nof the\n-T, --upload-file\nargument, meaning that you can\nupload multiple files to a single URL by using the same URL\nglobbing style supported in the URL.\nWhen uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is\nassumed to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the\nnecessary set of headers and mail body formatted correctly\nby the user as curl does not transcode nor encode it\nfurther in any way.\n-T, --upload-file\ncan be used several times in a command\nline\nExamples:\ncurl -T file\nhttps://example.com\ncurl -T \"img[1-1000].png\" ftp://ftp.example.com/\ncurl --upload-file \"{file1,file2}\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-G, --get\n,\n-I, --head\n,\n-X, --request\nand\n-d,\n--data\n.\n--url <url>\nSpecify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when\nyou want to specify URL(s) in a config file.\nIf the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as\n\"http://\" or \"ftp://\" etc) then curl makes a guess based on\nthe host. If the outermost subdomain name matches DICT,\nFTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that protocol is used,\notherwise HTTP is used. Guessing can be avoided by\nproviding a full URL including the scheme, or disabled by\nsetting a default protocol (added in 7.45.0), see\n--proto-default\nfor details.\nTo control where this URL is written, use the\n-o, --output\nor the\n-O, --remote-name\noptions.\nWARNING\n: On Windows, particular file:// accesses can be\nconverted to network accesses by the operating system.\nBeware!\n--url\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --url\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-:, --next\nand\n-K, --config\n.\n--url-query <data>\n(all) This option adds a piece of data, usually a name +\nvalue pair, to the end of the URL query part. The syntax is\nidentical to that used for\n--data-urlencode\nwith one\nextension:\nIf the argument starts with a '+' (plus), the rest of the\nstring is provided as-is unencoded.\nThe query part of a URL is the one following the question\nmark on the right end.\n--url-query\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExamples:\ncurl --url-query name=val\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --url-query =encodethis\nhttp://example.net/foo\ncurl --url-query name@file\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --url-query @fileonly\nhttps://example.com\ncurl --url-query \"+name=%20foo\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n--data-urlencode\nand\n-G, --get\n. Added in 7.87.0.\n-B, --use-ascii\n(FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be\nenforced by using a URL that ends with \";type=A\". This\noption causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for\nwin32 systems.\nProviding\n-B, --use-ascii\nmultiple times has no extra\neffect.  Disable it again with --no-use-ascii.\nExample:\ncurl -B ftp://example.com/README\nSee also\n--crlf\nand\n--data-ascii\n.\n-u, --user <user:password>\nSpecify the user name and password to use for server\nauthentication. Overrides\n-n, --netrc\nand\n--netrc-optional\n.\nIf you simply specify the user name, curl prompts for a\npassword.\nThe user name and passwords are split up on the first\ncolon, which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user\nname with this option. The password can, still.\nOn systems where it works, curl hides the given option\nargument from process listings. This is not enough to\nprotect credentials from possibly getting seen by other\nusers on the same system as they still are visible for a\nbrief moment before cleared. Such sensitive data should be\nretrieved from a file instead or similar and never used in\nclear text in a command line.\nWhen using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you\nshould include the Windows domain name in the user name, in\norder for the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos\nTicket. If you do not, then the initial authentication\nhandshake may fail.\nWhen using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as\nthe user name, without the domain, if there is a single\ndomain and forest in your setup for example.\nTo specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name\nor UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example,\nEXAMPLE\\user and user@example.com respectively.\nIf you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform\nKerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then\nyou can tell curl to select the user name and password from\nyour environment by specifying a single colon with this\noption: \"-u :\".\nIf\n-u, --user\nis provided several times, the last set value\nis used.\nExample:\ncurl -u user:secret\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-n, --netrc\nand\n-K, --config\n.\n-A, --user-agent <name>\n(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP\nserver. To encode blanks in the string, surround the string\nwith single quote marks. This header can also be set with\nthe\n-H, --header\nor the\n--proxy-header\noptions.\nIf you give an empty argument to\n-A, --user-agent\n(\"\"), it\nremoves the header completely from the request. If you\nprefer a blank header, you can set it to a single space (\"\n\").\nIf\n-A, --user-agent\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl -A \"Agent 007\"\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-H, --header\nand\n--proxy-header\n.\n--variable <[%]name=text/@file>\nSet a variable with \"name=content\" or \"name@file\" (where\n\"file\" can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)). The name\nis a case sensitive identifier that must consist of no\nother letters than a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. The\nspecified content is then associated with this identifier.\nSetting the same variable name again overwrites the old\ncontents with the new.\nThe contents of a variable can be referenced in a later\ncommand line option when that option name is prefixed with\n\"--expand-\", and the name is used as \"{{name}}\" (without\nthe quotes).\n--variable\ncan import environment variables into the name\nspace. Opt to either require the environment variable to be\nset or provide a default value for the variable in case it\nis not already set.\n--variable\n%name imports the variable called 'name' but\nexits with an error if that environment variable is not\nalready set. To provide a default value if the environment\nvariable is not set, use\n--variable\n%name=content or\n--variable\n%name@content. Note that on some systems - but\nnot all - environment variables are case insensitive.\nWhen expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions\nthat can make the variable contents more convenient to use.\nYou apply a function to a variable expansion by adding a\ncolon and then list the desired functions in a\ncomma-separated list that is evaluated in a left-to-right\norder. Variable content holding null bytes that are not\nencoded when expanded, causes an error.\nAvailable functions:\ntrim   removes all leading and trailing white space.\njson   outputs the content using JSON string quoting rules.\nurl    shows the content URL (percent) encoded.\nb64    expands the variable base64 encoded\n--variable\ncan be used several times in a command line\nExample:\ncurl --variable name=smith\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-K, --config\n. Added in 8.3.0.\n-v, --verbose\nMakes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for\ndebugging and seeing what's going on \"under the hood\". A\nline starting with '>' means \"header data\" sent by curl,\n'<' means \"header data\" received by curl that is hidden in\nnormal cases, and a line starting with '*' means additional\ninfo provided by curl.\nIf you only want HTTP headers in the output,\n-i, --include\nor\n-D, --dump-header\nmight be more suitable options.\nIf you think this option still does not give you enough\ndetails, consider using\n--trace\nor\n--trace-ascii\ninstead.\nNote that verbose output of curl activities and network\ntraffic might contain sensitive data, including user names,\ncredentials or secret data content. Be aware and be careful\nwhen sharing trace logs with others.\nThis option is global and does not need to be specified for\neach use of --next.\nProviding\n-v, --verbose\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-verbose.\nExample:\ncurl --verbose\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-i, --include\n,\n-s, --silent\n,\n--trace\nand\n--trace-ascii\n. This option is mutually exclusive to\n--trace\nand\n--trace-ascii\n.\n-V, --version\nDisplays information about curl and the libcurl version it\nuses.\nThe first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl\nand other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.\nThe second line (starts with \"Release-Date:\") shows the\nrelease date.\nThe third line (starts with \"Protocols:\") shows all\nprotocols that libcurl reports to support.\nThe fourth line (starts with \"Features:\") shows specific\nfeatures libcurl reports to offer. Available features\ninclude:\nalt-svc\nSupport for the Alt-Svc: header is provided.\nAsynchDNS\nThis curl uses asynchronous name resolves.\nAsynchronous name resolves can be done using either\nthe c-ares or the threaded resolver backends.\nbrotli Support for automatic brotli compression over\nHTTP(S).\nCharConv\ncurl was built with support for character set\nconversions (like EBCDIC)\nDebug  This curl uses a libcurl built with Debug. This\nenables more error-tracking and memory debugging\netc. For curl-developers only!\ngsasl  The built-in SASL authentication includes extensions\nto support SCRAM because libcurl was built with\nlibgsasl.\nGSS-API\nGSS-API is supported.\nHSTS   HSTS support is present.\nHTTP2  HTTP/2 support has been built-in.\nHTTP3  HTTP/3 support has been built-in.\nHTTPS-proxy\nThis curl is built to support HTTPS proxy.\nIDN    This curl supports IDN - international domain names.\nIPv6   You can use IPv6 with this.\nKerberos\nKerberos V5 authentication is supported.\nLargefile\nThis curl supports transfers of large files, files\nlarger than 2GB.\nlibz   Automatic decompression (via gzip, deflate) of\ncompressed files over HTTP is supported.\nMultiSSL\nThis curl supports multiple TLS backends.\nNTLM   NTLM authentication is supported.\nNTLM_WB\nNTLM delegation to winbind helper is supported.\nPSL    PSL is short for Public Suffix List and means that\nthis curl has been built with knowledge about\n\"public suffixes\".\nSPNEGO SPNEGO authentication is supported.\nSSL    SSL versions of various protocols are supported,\nsuch as HTTPS, FTPS, POP3S and so on.\nSSPI   SSPI is supported.\nTLS-SRP\nSRP (Secure Remote Password) authentication is\nsupported for TLS.\nTrackMemory\nDebug memory tracking is supported.\nUnicode\nUnicode support on Windows.\nUnixSockets\nUnix sockets support is provided.\nzstd   Automatic decompression (via zstd) of compressed\nfiles over HTTP is supported.\nExample:\ncurl --version\nSee also\n-h, --help\nand\n-M, --manual\n.\n-w, --write-out <format>\nMake curl display information on stdout after a completed\ntransfer. The format is a string that may contain plain\ntext mixed with any number of variables. The format can be\nspecified as a literal \"string\", or you can have curl read\nthe format from a file with \"@filename\" and to tell curl to\nread the format from stdin you write \"@-\".\nThe variables present in the output format are substituted\nby the value or text that curl thinks fit, as described\nbelow. All variables are specified as %{variable_name} and\nto output a normal % you just write them as %%. You can\noutput a newline by using \\n, a carriage return with \\r and\na tab space with \\t.\nThe output is by default written to standard output, but\ncan be changed with %{stderr} and %output{}.\nOutput HTTP headers from the most recent request by using\n%header{name}\nwhere\nname\nis the case insensitive name of\nthe header (without the trailing colon). The header\ncontents are exactly as sent over the network, with leading\nand trailing whitespace trimmed (added in 7.84.0).\nSelect a specific target destination file to write the\noutput to, by using\n%output{name}\n(added in curl 8.3.0)\nwhere\nname\nis the full file name. The output following that\ninstruction is then written to that file. More than one\n%output{}\ninstruction can be specified in the same\nwrite-out argument. If the file name cannot be created,\ncurl leaves the output destination to the one used prior to\nthe\n%output{}\ninstruction. Use\n%output{>>name}\nto append\ndata to an existing file.\nNOTE:\nIn Windows the %-symbol is a special symbol used to\nexpand environment variables. In batch files all\noccurrences of % must be doubled when using this option to\nproperly escape. If this option is used at the command\nprompt then the % cannot be escaped and unintended\nexpansion is possible.\nThe variables available are:\ncerts  Output the certificate chain with details. Supported\nonly by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Schannel and Secure\nTransport backends. (Added in 7.88.0)\ncontent_type\nThe Content-Type of the requested document, if there\nwas any.\nerrormsg\nThe error message. (Added in 7.75.0)\nexitcode\nThe numerical exit code of the transfer.

This\nis only meaningful if curl is told to write to a\nfile with the\n-O, --remote-name\nor\n-o, --output\noption. It's most useful in combination with the\n-J,\n--remote-header-name\noption.\nftp_entry_path\nThe initial path curl ended up in when logging on to\nthe remote FTP server.\nheader_json\nA JSON object with all HTTP response headers from\nthe recent transfer. Values are provided as arrays,\nsince in the case of multiple headers there can be\nmultiple values. (Added in 7.83.0)\nThe header names provided in lowercase, listed in\norder of appearance over the wire. Except for\nduplicated headers. They are grouped on the first\noccurrence of that header, each value is presented\nin the JSON array.\nhttp_code\nThe numerical response code that was found in the\nlast retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer.\nhttp_connect\nThe numerical code that was found in the last\nresponse (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.\nhttp_version\nThe http version that was effectively used.

Bytes per second.\nssl_verify_result\nThe result of the SSL peer certificate verification\nthat was requested. 0 means the verification was\nsuccessful.\nstderr From this point on, the\n-w, --write-out\noutput is\nwritten to standard error. (Added in 7.63.0)\nstdout From this point on, the\n-w, --write-out\noutput is\nwritten to standard output.  This is the default,\nbut can be used to switch back after switching to\nstderr.  (Added in 7.63.0)\ntime_appconnect\nThe time, in seconds, it took from the start until\nthe SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host\nwas completed.\ntime_connect\nThe time, in seconds, it took from the start until\nthe TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was\ncompleted.\ntime_namelookup\nThe time, in seconds, it took from the start until\nthe name resolving was completed.\ntime_pretransfer\nThe time, in seconds, it took from the start until\nthe file transfer was just about to begin.

(Added in\n8.1.0)\nurl.password\nThe password part of the URL that was fetched.\n(Added in 8.1.0)\nurl.options\nThe options part of the URL that was fetched. (Added\nin 8.1.0)\nurl.host\nThe host part of the URL that was fetched. (Added in\n8.1.0)\nurl.port\nThe port number of the URL that was fetched. If no\nport number was specified, but the URL scheme is\nknown, that scheme's default port number is shown.\n(Added in 8.1.0)\nurl.path\nThe path part of the URL that was fetched. (Added in\n8.1.0)\nurl.query\nThe query part of the URL that was fetched.

(Added in 8.1.0)\nurle.zoneid\nThe zone id part of the effective (last) URL that\nwas fetched. (Added in 8.1.0)\nurlnum The URL index number of this transfer, 0-indexed.\nUnglobbed URLs share the same index number as the\norigin globbed URL. (Added in 7.75.0)\nurl_effective\nThe URL that was fetched last. This is most\nmeaningful if you have told curl to follow location:\nheaders.\nIf\n-w, --write-out\nis provided several times, the last set\nvalue is used.\nExample:\ncurl -w '%{response_code}\\n'\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-v, --verbose\nand\n-I, --head\n.\n--xattr\nWhen saving output to a file, this option tells curl to\nstore certain file metadata in extended file attributes.\nCurrently, the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url\nattribute and, for HTTP, the content type is stored in the\nmime_type attribute. If the file system does not support\nextended attributes, a warning is issued.\nProviding\n--xattr\nmultiple times has no extra effect.\nDisable it again with --no-xattr.\nExample:\ncurl --xattr -o storage\nhttps://example.com\nSee also\n-R, --remote-time\n,\n-w, --write-out\nand\n-v,\n--verbose\n.\nFILES\ntop\n~/.curlrc\nDefault config file, see\n-K, --config\nfor details.\nENVIRONMENT\ntop\nThe environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper\ncase. The lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an\nexception as it is only available in lower case.\nUsing an environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect\nas using the\n-x, --proxy\noption.\nhttp_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]\nSets the proxy server to use for HTTP.\nHTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]\nSets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.\n[url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]\nSets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the\nprotocol is a protocol that curl supports and as specified\nin a URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP, etc.\nALL_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]\nSets the proxy server to use if no protocol-specific proxy\nis set.\nNO_PROXY <comma-separated list of hosts/domains>\nlist of host names that should not go through any proxy. If\nset to an asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts. Each\nname in this list is matched as either a domain name which\ncontains the hostname, or the hostname itself.\nThis environment variable disables use of the proxy even\nwhen specified with the\n-x, --proxy\noption. That is\nNO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x\nhttp://proxy.example.com\nhttp://direct.example.com\naccesses\nthe target URL directly, and\nNO_PROXY=direct.example.com\ncurl -x\nhttp://proxy.example.com\nhttp://somewhere.example.com\naccesses the target URL\nthrough the proxy.\nThe list of host names can also be include numerical IP\naddresses, and IPv6 versions should then be given without\nenclosing brackets.\nIP addresses can be specified using CIDR notation: an\nappended slash and number specifies the number of \"network\nbits\" out of the address to use in the comparison (added in\n7.86.0). For example \"192.168.0.0/16\" would match all\naddresses starting with \"192.168\".\nAPPDATA <dir>\nOn Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the\nhome directory. If the primary home variable are all unset.\nCOLUMNS <terminal width>\nIf set, the specified number of characters is used as the\nterminal width when the alternative progress-bar is shown.\nIf not set, curl tries to figure it out using other ways.\nCURL_CA_BUNDLE <file>\nIf set, it is used as the\n--cacert\nvalue.\nCURL_HOME <dir>\nIf set, is the first variable curl checks when trying to\nfind its home directory. If not set, it continues to check\nXDG_CONFIG_HOME\nCURL_SSL_BACKEND <TLS backend>\nIf curl was built with support for \"MultiSSL\", meaning that\nit has built-in support for more than one TLS backend, this\nenvironment variable can be set to the case insensitive\nname of the particular backend to use when curl is invoked.\nSetting a name that is not a built-in alternative makes\ncurl stay with the default.\nSSL backend names (case-insensitive):\nbearssl\n,\ngnutls\n,\nmbedtls\n,\nopenssl\n,\nrustls\n,\nschannel\n,\nsecure-transport\n,\nwolfssl\nHOME <dir>\nIf set, this is used to find the home directory when that\nis needed. Like when looking for the default .curlrc.\nCURL_HOME\nand\nXDG_CONFIG_HOME\nhave preference.\nQLOGDIR <directory name>\nIf curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this\nenvironment variable to a local directory makes curl\nproduce\nqlogs\nin that directory, using file names named\nafter the destination connection id (in hex). Do note that\nthese files can become rather large. Works with the ngtcp2\nand quiche QUIC backends.\nSHELL  Used on VMS when trying to detect if using a\nDCL\nor a\nunix\nshell.\nSSL_CERT_DIR <dir>\nIf set, it is used as the\n--capath\nvalue.\nSSL_CERT_FILE <path>\nIf set, it is used as the\n--cacert\nvalue.\nSSLKEYLOGFILE <file name>\nIf you set this environment variable to a file name, curl\nstores TLS secrets from its connections in that file when\ninvoked to enable you to analyze the TLS traffic in real\ntime using network analyzing tools such as Wireshark. This\nworks with the following TLS backends: OpenSSL, libressl,\nBoringSSL, GnuTLS and wolfSSL.\nUSERPROFILE <dir>\nOn Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the\nhome directory. If the other, primary, variable are all\nunset. If set, curl uses the path \"$USERPROFILE\\Application\nData\".\nXDG_CONFIG_HOME <dir>\nIf\nCURL_HOME\nis not set, this variable is checked when\nlooking for a default .curlrc file.\nPROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES\ntop\nThe proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to\nspecify alternative proxy protocols.\nIf no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string\ndoes not match a supported one, the proxy is treated as an HTTP\nproxy.\nThe supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:\nhttp://\nMakes it use it as an HTTP proxy.

[\nURL\n]...\nDESCRIPTION\ntop\nGNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files\nfrom the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well\nas retrieval through HTTP proxies.\nWget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the\nbackground, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to\nstart a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget\nfinish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require\nconstant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when\ntransferring a lot of data.\nWget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create\nlocal versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory\nstructure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as\n\"recursive downloading.\"  While doing that, Wget respects the\nRobot Exclusion Standard (\n/robots.txt\n).  Wget can be instructed to\nconvert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files,\nfor offline viewing.\nWget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable\nnetwork connections; if a download fails due to a network problem,\nit will keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If\nthe server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to\ncontinue the download from where it left off.\nOPTIONS\ntop\nOption Syntax\nSince Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments,\nevery option has a long form along with the short one.  Long\noptions are more convenient to remember, but take time to type.\nYou may freely mix different option styles, or specify options\nafter the command-line arguments.  Thus you may write:\nwget -r --tries=10\nhttp://fly.srk.fer.hr/\n-o log\nThe space between the option accepting an argument and the\nargument may be omitted.  Instead of\n-o log\nyou can write\n-olog\n.\nYou may put several options that do not require arguments\ntogether, like:\nwget -drc <URL>\nThis is completely equivalent to:\nwget -d -r -c <URL>\nSince the options can be specified after the arguments, you may\nterminate them with\n--\n.  So the following will try to download URL\n-x\n, reporting failure to\nlog\n:\nwget -o log -- -x\nThe options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the\nconvention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This\ncan be useful to clear the\n.wgetrc\nsettings.  For instance, if\nyour\n.wgetrc\nsets \"exclude_directories\" to\n/cgi-bin\n, the following\nexample will first reset it, and then set it to exclude\n/~nobody\nand\n/~somebody\n.  You can also clear the lists in\n.wgetrc\n.\nwget -X \"\" -X /~nobody,/~somebody\nMost options that do not accept arguments are\nboolean\noptions, so\nnamed because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no\n(\"boolean\") variable.  For example,\n--follow-ftp\ntells Wget to\nfollow FTP links from HTML files and, on the other hand,\n--no-glob\ntells it not to perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A boolean\noption is either\naffirmative\nor\nnegative\n(beginning with\n--no\n).\nAll such options share several properties.\nUnless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior\nis the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the\ndocumented existence of\n--follow-ftp\nassumes that the default is\nto\nnot\nfollow FTP links from HTML pages.\nAffirmative options can be negated by prepending the\n--no-\nto the\noption name; negative options can be negated by omitting the\n--no-\nprefix.  This might seem superfluous---if the default for an\naffirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way\nto explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact\nchange the default.  For instance, using \"follow_ftp = on\" in\n.wgetrc\nmakes Wget\nfollow\nFTP links by default, and using\n--no-follow-ftp\nis the only way to restore the factory default\nfrom the command line.\nBasic Startup Options\n-V\n--version\nDisplay the version of Wget.\n-h\n--help\nPrint a help message describing all of Wget's command-line\noptions.\n-b\n--background\nGo to background immediately after startup.  If no output file\nis specified via the\n-o\n, output is redirected to\nwget-log\n.\n-e\ncommand\n--execute\ncommand\nExecute\ncommand\nas if it were a part of\n.wgetrc\n.  A command\nthus invoked will be executed\nafter\nthe commands in\n.wgetrc\n,\nthus taking precedence over them.  If you need to specify more\nthan one wgetrc command, use multiple instances of\n-e\n.\nLogging and Input File Options\n-o\nlogfile\n--output-file=\nlogfile\nLog all messages to\nlogfile\n.  The messages are normally\nreported to standard error.\n-a\nlogfile\n--append-output=\nlogfile\nAppend to\nlogfile\n.  This is the same as\n-o\n, only it appends to\nlogfile\ninstead of overwriting the old log file.  If\nlogfile\ndoes not exist, a new file is created.\n-d\n--debug\nTurn on debug output, meaning various information important to\nthe developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your\nsystem administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without\ndebug support, in which case\n-d\nwill not work.  Please note\nthat compiling with debug support is always safe---Wget\ncompiled with the debug support will\nnot\nprint any debug info\nunless requested with\n-d\n.\n-q\n--quiet\nTurn off Wget's output.\n-v\n--verbose\nTurn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The\ndefault output is verbose.\n-nv\n--no-verbose\nTurn off verbose without being completely quiet (use\n-q\nfor\nthat), which means that error messages and basic information\nstill get printed.\n--report-speed=\ntype\nOutput bandwidth as\ntype\n.  The only accepted value is\nbits\n.\n-i\nfile\n--input-file=\nfile\nRead URLs from a local or external\nfile\n.  If\n-\nis specified as\nfile\n, URLs are read from the standard input.  (Use\n./-\nto read\nfrom a file literally named\n-\n.)\nIf this function is used, no URLs need be present on the\ncommand line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and\nin an input file, those on the command lines will be the first\nones to be retrieved.  If\n--force-html\nis not specified, then\nfile\nshould consist of a series of URLs, one per line.\nHowever, if you specify\n--force-html\n, the document will be\nregarded as\nhtml\n.  In that case you may have problems with\nrelative links, which you can solve either by adding \"<base\nhref=\"\nurl\n\">\" to the documents or by specifying\n--base=\nurl\non\nthe command line.\nIf the\nfile\nis an external one, the document will be\nautomatically treated as\nhtml\nif the Content-Type matches\ntext/html\n.  Furthermore, the\nfile\n's location will be\nimplicitly used as base href if none was specified.\nIf the\nfile\nis a local file, on systems that support it, it\nwill be opened with the \"O_NONBLOCK\" flag to allow\nnon-blocking reads from the file.\nWget\nwill attempt to\ncontinue reading from the file until EOF is reached or it is\nclosed. This allows one to stream a list of files for\nretrieval where the list is dynamically generated during the\nexecution of the process. Currently, this feature is not\navailable on Windows platforms.\n--input-metalink=\nfile\nDownloads files covered in local Metalink\nfile\n. Metalink\nversion 3 and 4 are supported.\n--keep-badhash\nKeeps downloaded Metalink's files with a bad hash. It appends\n.badhash to the name of Metalink's files which have a checksum\nmismatch, except without overwriting existing files.\n--metalink-over-http\nIssues HTTP HEAD request instead of GET and extracts Metalink\nmetadata from response headers. Then it switches to Metalink\ndownload.  If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls\nback to ordinary HTTP download.  Enables\nContent-Type:\napplication/metalink4+xml\nfiles download/processing.\n--metalink-index=\nnumber\nSet the Metalink\napplication/metalink4+xml\nmetaurl ordinal\nNUMBER. From 1 to the total number of\n\"application/metalink4+xml\" available.  Specify 0 or\ninf\nto\nchoose the first good one.  Metaurls, such as those from a\n--metalink-over-http\n, may have been sorted by priority key's\nvalue; keep this in mind to choose the right NUMBER.\n--preferred-location\nSet preferred location for Metalink resources. This has effect\nif multiple resources with same priority are available.\n--xattr\nEnable use of file system's extended attributes to save the\noriginal URL and the Referer HTTP header value if used.\nBe aware that the URL might contain private information like\naccess tokens or credentials.\n-F\n--force-html\nWhen input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an\nHTML file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from\nexisting HTML files on your local disk, by adding \"<base\nhref=\"\nurl\n\">\" to HTML, or using the\n--base\ncommand-line option.\n-B\nURL\n--base=\nURL\nResolves relative links using\nURL\nas the point of reference,\nwhen reading links from an HTML file specified via the\n-i\n/\n--input-file\noption (together with\n--force-html\n, or when\nthe input file was fetched remotely from a server describing\nit as HTML). This is equivalent to the presence of a \"BASE\"\ntag in the HTML input file, with\nURL\nas the value for the\n\"href\" attribute.\nFor instance, if you specify\nhttp://foo/bar/a.html\nfor\nURL\n,\nand Wget reads\n../baz/b.html\nfrom the input file, it would be\nresolved to\nhttp://foo/baz/b.html\n.\n--config=\nFILE\nSpecify the location of a startup file you wish to use instead\nof the default one(s). Use --no-config to disable reading of\nconfig files.  If both --config and --no-config are given,\n--no-config is ignored.\n--rejected-log=\nlogfile\nLogs all URL rejections to\nlogfile\nas comma separated values.\nThe values include the reason of rejection, the URL and the\nparent URL it was found in.\nDownload Options\n--bind-address=\nADDRESS\nWhen making client TCP/IP connections, bind to\nADDRESS\non the\nlocal machine.\nADDRESS\nmay be specified as a hostname or IP\naddress.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound\nto multiple IPs.\n--bind-dns-address=\nADDRESS\n[libcares only] This address overrides the route for DNS\nrequests. If you ever need to circumvent the standard settings\nfrom /etc/resolv.conf, this option together with\n--dns-servers\nis your friend.\nADDRESS\nmust be specified either as IPv4 or\nIPv6 address.  Wget needs to be built with libcares for this\noption to be available.\n--dns-servers=\nADDRESSES\n[libcares only] The given address(es) override the standard\nnameserver addresses,  e.g. as configured in /etc/resolv.conf.\nADDRESSES\nmay be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses,\ncomma-separated.  Wget needs to be built with libcares for\nthis option to be available.\n-t\nnumber\n--tries=\nnumber\nSet number of tries to\nnumber\n. Specify 0 or\ninf\nfor infinite\nretrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the\nexception of fatal errors like \"connection refused\" or \"not\nfound\" (404), which are not retried.\n-O\nfile\n--output-document=\nfile\nThe documents will not be written to the appropriate files,\nbut all will be concatenated together and written to\nfile\n.  If\n-\nis used as\nfile\n, documents will be printed to standard\noutput, disabling link conversion.  (Use\n./-\nto print to a\nfile literally named\n-\n.)\nUse of\n-O\nis\nnot\nintended to mean simply \"use the name\nfile\ninstead of the one in the URL;\" rather, it is analogous to\nshell redirection:\nwget -O file\nhttp://foo\nis intended to work\nlike\nwget -O -\nhttp://foo\n> file\n;\nfile\nwill be truncated\nimmediately, and\nall\ndownloaded content will be written there.\nFor this reason,\n-N\n(for timestamp-checking) is not supported\nin combination with\n-O\n: since\nfile\nis always newly created, it\nwill always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be\nissued if this combination is used.\nSimilarly, using\n-r\nor\n-p\nwith\n-O\nmay not work as you expect:\nWget won't just download the first file to\nfile\nand then\ndownload the rest to their normal names:\nall\ndownloaded\ncontent will be placed in\nfile\n. This was disabled in version\n1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as\nthere are some cases where this behavior can actually have\nsome use.\nA combination with\n-nc\nis only accepted if the given output\nfile does not exist.\nNote that a combination with\n-k\nis only permitted when\ndownloading a single document, as in that case it will just\nconvert all relative URIs to external ones;\n-k\nmakes no sense\nfor multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a\nsingle file;\n-k\ncan be used only when the output is a regular\nfile.\n-nc\n--no-clobber\nIf a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,\nWget's behavior depends on a few options, including\n-nc\n.  In\ncertain cases, the local file will be\nclobbered\n, or\noverwritten, upon repeated download.  In other cases it will\nbe preserved.\nWhen running Wget without\n-N\n,\n-nc\n,\n-r\n, or\n-p\n, downloading the\nsame file in the same directory will result in the original\ncopy of\nfile\nbeing preserved and the second copy being named\nfile\n.1\n.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy\nwill be named\nfile\n.2\n, and so on.  (This is also the behavior\nwith\n-nd\n, even if\n-r\nor\n-p\nare in effect.)  When\n-nc\nis\nspecified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse\nto download newer copies of\nfile\n.  Therefore, \"\"no-clobber\"\"\nis actually a misnomer in this mode---it's not clobbering\nthat's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already\npreventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving\nthat's prevented.\nWhen running Wget with\n-r\nor\n-p\n, but without\n-N\n,\n-nd\n, or\n-nc\n,\nre-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply\noverwriting the old.  Adding\n-nc\nwill prevent this behavior,\ninstead causing the original version to be preserved and any\nnewer copies on the server to be ignored.\nWhen running Wget with\n-N\n, with or without\n-r\nor\n-p\n, the\ndecision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a\nfile depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the\nfile.\n-nc\nmay not be specified at the same time as\n-N\n.\nA combination with\n-O\n/\n--output-document\nis only accepted if\nthe given output file does not exist.\nNote that when\n-nc\nis specified, files with the suffixes\n.html\nor\n.htm\nwill be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if\nthey had been retrieved from the Web.\n--backups=\nbackups\nBefore (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by\nadding a\n.1\nsuffix (\n_1\non VMS) to the file name.  Such backup\nfiles are rotated to\n.2\n,\n.3\n, and so on, up to\nbackups\n(and\nlost beyond that).\n--no-netrc\nDo not try to obtain credentials from\n.netrc\nfile. By default\n.netrc\nfile is searched for credentials in case none have been\npassed on command line and authentication is required.\n-c\n--continue\nContinue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful\nwhen you want to finish up a download started by a previous\ninstance of Wget, or by another program.  For instance:\nwget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z\nIf there is a file named\nls-lR.Z\nin the current directory,\nWget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote\nfile, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from\nan offset equal to the length of the local file.\nNote that you don't need to specify this option if you just\nwant the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a\nfile should the connection be lost midway through.  This is\nthe default behavior.\n-c\nonly affects resumption of downloads\nstarted\nprior\nto this invocation of Wget, and whose local\nfiles are still sitting around.\nWithout\n-c\n, the previous example would just download the\nremote file to\nls-lR.Z.1\n, leaving the truncated\nls-lR.Z\nfile\nalone.\nIf you use\n-c\non a non-empty file, and the server does not\nsupport continued downloading, Wget will restart the download\nfrom scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely.\nBeginning with Wget 1.7, if you use\n-c\non a file which is of\nequal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to\ndownload the file and print an explanatory message.  The same\nhappens when the file is smaller on the server than locally\n(presumably because it was changed on the server since your\nlast download attempt)---because \"continuing\" is not\nmeaningful, no download occurs.\nOn the other side of the coin, while using\n-c\n, any file that's\nbigger on the server than locally will be considered an\nincomplete download and only \"(length(remote) -\nlength(local))\" bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the\nend of the local file.  This behavior can be desirable in\ncertain cases---for instance, you can use\nwget -c\nto download\njust the new portion that's been appended to a data collection\nor log file.\nHowever, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been\nchanged\n, as opposed to just\nappended\nto, you'll end up with a\ngarbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local\nfile is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to\nbe especially careful of this when using\n-c\nin conjunction\nwith\n-r\n, since every file will be considered as an \"incomplete\ndownload\" candidate.\nAnother instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to\nuse\n-c\nis if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a\n\"transfer interrupted\" string into the local file.  In the\nfuture a \"rollback\" option may be added to deal with this\ncase.\nNote that\n-c\nonly works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers\nthat support the \"Range\" header.\n--start-pos=\nOFFSET\nStart downloading at zero-based position\nOFFSET\n.  Offset may\nbe expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the `k' suffix, or\nmegabytes with the `m' suffix, etc.\n--start-pos\nhas higher precedence over\n--continue\n.  When\n--start-pos\nand\n--continue\nare both specified, wget will emit\na warning then proceed as if\n--continue\nwas absent.\nServer support for continued download is required, otherwise\n--start-pos\ncannot help.  See\n-c\nfor details.\n--progress=\ntype\nSelect the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.\nLegal indicators are \"dot\" and \"bar\".\nThe \"bar\" indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII\nprogress bar graphics (a.k.a \"thermometer\" display) indicating\nthe status of retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the\n\"dot\" bar will be used by default.\nUse\n--progress=dot\nto switch to the \"dot\" display.  It traces\nthe retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot\nrepresenting a fixed amount of downloaded data.\nThe progress\ntype\ncan also take one or more parameters.  The\nparameters vary based on the\ntype\nselected.  Parameters to\ntype\nare passed by appending them to the type sperated by a\ncolon (:) like this:\n--progress=\ntype\n:\nparameter1\n:\nparameter2\n.\nWhen using the dotted retrieval, you may set the\nstyle\nby\nspecifying the type as\ndot:\nstyle\n.  Different styles assign\ndifferent meaning to one dot.  With the \"default\" style each\ndot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots\nin a line.  The \"binary\" style has a more \"computer\"-like\norientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line\n(which makes for 384K lines).  The \"mega\" style is suitable\nfor downloading large files---each dot represents 64K\nretrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on\neach line (so each line contains 3M).  If \"mega\" is not enough\nthen you can use the \"giga\" style---each dot represents 1M\nretrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32 dots on\neach line (so each line contains 32M).\nWith\n--progress=bar\n, there are currently two possible\nparameters,\nforce\nand\nnoscroll\n.\nWhen the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls\nback to \"dot\", even if\n--progress=bar\nwas passed to Wget\nduring invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the\n\"bar\" output forced by using the \"force\" parameter as\n--progress=bar:force\n.\nBy default, the\nbar\nstyle progress bar scroll the name of the\nfile from left to right for the file being downloaded if the\nfilename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.\nIn certain cases, such as with\n--progress=bar:force\n, one may\nnot want the scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By\npassing the \"noscroll\" parameter, Wget can be forced to\ndisplay as much of the filename as possible without scrolling\nthrough it.\nNote that you can set the default style using the \"progress\"\ncommand in\n.wgetrc\n.  That setting may be overridden from the\ncommand line.  For example, to force the bar output without\nscrolling, use\n--progress=bar:force:noscroll\n.\n--show-progress\nForce wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.\nBy default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose\nmode.  One may however, want wget to display the progress bar\non screen in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like\n--no-verbose\nor\n--quiet\n.  This is often a desired a property\nwhen invoking wget to download several small/large files.  In\nsuch a case, wget could simply be invoked with this parameter\nto get a much cleaner output on the screen.\nThis option will also force the progress bar to be printed to\nstderr\nwhen used alongside the\n--output-file\noption.\n-N\n--timestamping\nTurn on time-stamping.\n--no-if-modified-since\nDo not send If-Modified-Since header in\n-N\nmode. Send\npreliminary HEAD request instead. This has only effect in\n-N\nmode.\n--no-use-server-timestamps\nDon't set the local file's timestamp by the one on the server.\nBy default, when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set\nto match those from the remote file. This allows the use of\n--timestamping\non subsequent invocations of wget. However, it\nis sometimes useful to base the local file's timestamp on when\nit was actually downloaded; for that purpose, the\n--no-use-server-timestamps\noption has been provided.\n-S\n--server-response\nPrint the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by\nFTP servers.\n--spider\nWhen invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web\nspider\n, which means that it will not download the pages, just\ncheck that they are there.  For example, you can use Wget to\ncheck your bookmarks:\nwget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html\nThis feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the\nfunctionality of real web spiders.\n-T seconds\n--timeout=\nseconds\nSet the network timeout to\nseconds\nseconds.  This is\nequivalent to specifying\n--dns-timeout\n,\n--connect-timeout\n, and\n--read-timeout\n, all at the same time.\nWhen interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout\nand abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents\nanomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only\ntimeout enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout.\nSetting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether.  Unless you\nknow what you are doing, it is best not to change the default\ntimeout settings.\nAll timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as\nsubsecond values.  For example,\n0.1\nseconds is a legal (though\nunwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for\nchecking server response times or for testing network latency.\n--dns-timeout=\nseconds\nSet the DNS lookup timeout to\nseconds\nseconds.  DNS lookups\nthat don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By\ndefault, there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that\nimplemented by system libraries.\n--connect-timeout=\nseconds\nSet the connect timeout to\nseconds\nseconds.  TCP connections\nthat take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default,\nthere is no connect timeout, other than that implemented by\nsystem libraries.\n--read-timeout=\nseconds\nSet the read (and write) timeout to\nseconds\nseconds.  The\n\"time\" of this timeout refers to\nidle time\n: if, at any point\nin the download, no data is received for more than the\nspecified number of seconds, reading fails and the download is\nrestarted.  This option does not directly affect the duration\nof the entire download.\nOf course, the remote server may choose to terminate the\nconnection sooner than this option requires.  The default read\ntimeout is 900 seconds.\n--limit-rate=\namount\nLimit the download speed to\namount\nbytes per second.  Amount\nmay be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the\nk\nsuffix, or\nmegabytes with the\nm\nsuffix.  For example,\n--limit-rate=20k\nwill limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when,\nfor whatever reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire\navailable bandwidth.\nThis option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in\nconjunction with power suffixes; for example,\n--limit-rate=2.5k\nis a legal value.\nNote that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the\nappropriate amount of time after a network read that took less\ntime than specified by the rate.  Eventually this strategy\ncauses the TCP transfer to slow down to approximately the\nspecified rate.  However, it may take some time for this\nbalance to be achieved, so don't be surprised if limiting the\nrate doesn't work well with very small files.\n-w\nseconds\n--wait=\nseconds\nWait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.\nUse of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server\nload by making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in\nseconds, the time can be specified in minutes using the \"m\"\nsuffix, in hours using \"h\" suffix, or in days using \"d\"\nsuffix.\nSpecifying a large value for this option is useful if the\nnetwork or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait\nlong enough to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed\nbefore the retry.  The waiting interval specified by this\nfunction is influenced by \"--random-wait\", which see.\n--waitretry=\nseconds\nIf you don't want Wget to wait between\nevery\nretrieval, but\nonly between retries of failed downloads, you can use this\noption.  Wget will use\nlinear backoff\n, waiting 1 second after\nthe first failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds\nafter the second failure on that file, up to the maximum\nnumber of\nseconds\nyou specify.\nBy default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.\n--random-wait\nSome web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval\nprograms such as Wget by looking for statistically significant\nsimilarities in the time between requests. This option causes\nthe time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 *\nwait\nseconds, where\nwait\nwas specified using the\n--wait\noption, in\norder to mask Wget's presence from such analysis.\nA 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a\npopular consumer platform provided code to perform this\nanalysis on the fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the\nclass C address level to ensure automated retrieval programs\nwere blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied addresses.\nThe\n--random-wait\noption was inspired by this ill-advised\nrecommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site\ndue to the actions of one.\n--no-proxy\nDon't use proxies, even if the appropriate *_proxy environment\nvariable is defined.\n-Q\nquota\n--quota=\nquota\nSpecify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value\ncan be specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with\nk\nsuffix), or megabytes (with\nm\nsuffix).\nNote that quota will never affect downloading a single file.\nSo if you specify\nwget -Q10k\nhttps://example.com/ls-lR.gz\n, all\nof the\nls-lR.gz\nwill be downloaded.  The same goes even when\nseveral URLs are specified on the command-line.  The quota is\nchecked only at the end of each downloaded file, so it will\nnever result in a partially downloaded file. Thus you may\nsafely type\nwget -Q2m -i sites\n---download will be aborted\nafter the file that exhausts the quota is completely\ndownloaded.\nSetting quota to 0 or to\ninf\nunlimits the download quota.\n--no-dns-cache\nTurn off caching of DNS lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the\nIP addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to\nrepeatedly contact the DNS server for the same (typically\nsmall) set of hosts it retrieves from.  This cache exists in\nmemory only; a new Wget run will contact DNS again.\nHowever, it has been reported that in some situations it is\nnot desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a\nshort-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget\nissues a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to\n\"gethostbyname\" or \"getaddrinfo\") each time it makes a new\nconnection.  Please note that this option will\nnot\naffect\ncaching that might be performed by the resolving library or by\nan external caching layer, such as NSCD.\nIf you don't understand exactly what this option does, you\nprobably won't need it.\n--restrict-file-names=\nmodes\nChange which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped\nduring generation of local filenames.  Characters that are\nrestricted\nby this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with\n%HH\n,\nwhere\nHH\nis the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the\nrestricted character. This option may also be used to force\nall alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase.\nBy default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or\nsafe as part of file names on your operating system, as well\nas control characters that are typically unprintable.  This\noption is useful for changing these defaults, perhaps because\nyou are downloading to a non-native partition, or because you\nwant to disable escaping of the control characters, or you\nwant to further restrict characters to only those in the ASCII\nrange of values.\nThe\nmodes\nare a comma-separated set of text values. The\nacceptable values are\nunix\n,\nwindows\n,\nnocontrol\n,\nascii\n,\nlowercase\n, and\nuppercase\n. The values\nunix\nand\nwindows\nare\nmutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are\nlowercase\nand\nuppercase\n. Those last are special cases, as they\ndo not change the set of characters that would be escaped, but\nrather force local file paths to be converted either to lower-\nor uppercase.\nWhen \"unix\" is specified, Wget escapes the character\n/\nand the\ncontrol characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  This is\nthe default on Unix-like operating systems.\nWhen \"windows\" is given, Wget escapes the characters\n\\\n,\n|\n,\n/\n,\n:\n,\n?\n,\n\"\n,\n*\n,\n<\n,\n>\n, and the control characters in the ranges\n0--31 and 128--159.  In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode\nuses\n+\ninstead of\n:\nto separate host and port in local file\nnames, and uses\n@\ninstead of\n?\nto separate the query portion\nof the file name from the rest.  Therefore, a URL that would\nbe saved as\nwww.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah\nin Unix\nmode would be saved as\nwww.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah\nin Windows mode.\nThis mode is the default on Windows.\nIf you specify\nnocontrol\n, then the escaping of the control\ncharacters is also switched off. This option may make sense\nwhen you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8\ncharacters, on a system which can save and display filenames\nin UTF-8 (some possible byte values used in UTF-8 byte\nsequences fall in the range of values designated by Wget as\n\"controls\").\nThe\nascii\nmode is used to specify that any bytes whose values\nare outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater\nthan 127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving\nfilenames whose encoding does not match the one used locally.\n-4\n--inet4-only\n-6\n--inet6-only\nForce connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With\n--inet4-only\nor\n-4\n, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA\nrecords in DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses\nspecified in URLs.  Conversely, with\n--inet6-only\nor\n-6\n, Wget\nwill only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4\naddresses.\nNeither options should be needed normally.  By default, an\nIPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the\nhost's DNS record.  If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and\nIPv6 addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds\none it can connect to.  (Also see \"--prefer-family\" option\ndescribed below.)\nThese options can be used to deliberately force the use of\nIPv4 or IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually\nto aid debugging or to deal with broken network configuration.\nOnly one of\n--inet6-only\nand\n--inet4-only\nmay be specified at\nthe same time.  Neither option is available in Wget compiled\nwithout IPv6 support.\n--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6\nWhen given a choice of several addresses, connect to the\naddresses with specified address family first.  The address\norder returned by DNS is used without change by default.\nThis avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when\naccessing hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses\nfrom IPv4 networks.  For example,\nwww.kame.net\nresolves to\n2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085\nand to\n203.178.141.194\n.\nWhen the preferred family is \"IPv4\", the IPv4 address is used\nfirst; when the preferred family is \"IPv6\", the IPv6 address\nis used first; if the specified value is \"none\", the address\norder returned by DNS is used without change.\nUnlike\n-4\nand\n-6\n, this option doesn't inhibit access to any\naddress family, it only changes the\norder\nin which the\naddresses are accessed.  Also note that the reordering\nperformed by this option is\nstable\n---it doesn't affect order\nof addresses of the same family.  That is, the relative order\nof all IPv4 addresses and of all IPv6 addresses remains intact\nin all cases.\n--retry-connrefused\nConsider \"connection refused\" a transient error and try again.\nNormally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect\nto the site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that\nthe server is not running at all and that retries would not\nhelp.  This option is for mirroring unreliable sites whose\nservers tend to disappear for short periods of time.\n--user=\nuser\n--password=\npassword\nSpecify the username\nuser\nand password\npassword\nfor both FTP\nand HTTP file retrieval.  These parameters can be overridden\nusing the\n--ftp-user\nand\n--ftp-password\noptions for FTP\nconnections and the\n--http-user\nand\n--http-password\noptions\nfor HTTP connections.\n--ask-password\nPrompt for a password for each connection established. Cannot\nbe specified when\n--password\nis being used, because they are\nmutually exclusive.\n--use-askpass=\ncommand\nPrompt for a user and password using the specified command.\nIf no command is specified then the command in the environment\nvariable WGET_ASKPASS is used.  If WGET_ASKPASS is not set\nthen the command in the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS is\nused.\nYou can set the default command for use-askpass in the\n.wgetrc\n.  That setting may be overridden from the command\nline.\n--no-iri\nTurn off internationalized URI (IRI) support. Use\n--iri\nto\nturn it on. IRI support is activated by default.\nYou can set the default state of IRI support using the \"iri\"\ncommand in\n.wgetrc\n. That setting may be overridden from the\ncommand line.\n--local-encoding=\nencoding\nForce Wget to use\nencoding\nas the default system encoding.\nThat affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments\nfrom locale to UTF-8 for IRI support.\nWget use the function nl_langinfo() and then the \"CHARSET\"\nenvironment variable to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII is\nused.\nYou can set the default local encoding using the\n\"local_encoding\" command in\n.wgetrc\n. That setting may be\noverridden from the command line.\n--remote-encoding=\nencoding\nForce Wget to use\nencoding\nas the default remote server\nencoding.  That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files\nfrom remote encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch. This\noptions is only useful for IRI support, for the interpretation\nof non-ASCII characters.\nFor HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP \"Content-Type\"\nheader and in HTML \"Content-Type http-equiv\" meta tag.\nYou can set the default encoding using the \"remoteencoding\"\ncommand in\n.wgetrc\n. That setting may be overridden from the\ncommand line.\n--unlink\nForce Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing file.\nThis option is useful for downloading to the directory with\nhardlinks.\nDirectory Options\n-nd\n--no-directories\nDo not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving\nrecursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get\nsaved to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name\nshows up more than once, the filenames will get extensions\n.n\n).\n-x\n--force-directories\nThe opposite of\n-nd\n---create a hierarchy of directories, even\nif one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g.\nwget -x\nhttp://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt\nwill save the downloaded file\nto\nfly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt\n.\n-nH\n--no-host-directories\nDisable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,\ninvoking Wget with\n-r\nhttp://fly.srk.fer.hr/\nwill create a\nstructure of directories beginning with\nfly.srk.fer.hr/\n.  This\noption disables such behavior.\n--protocol-directories\nUse the protocol name as a directory component of local file\nnames.  For example, with this option,\nwget -r\nhttp://\nhost\nwill save to\nhttp/\nhost\n/...\nrather than just to\nhost\n/...\n.\n--cut-dirs=\nnumber\nIgnore\nnumber\ndirectory components.  This is useful for\ngetting a fine-grained control over the directory where\nrecursive retrieval will be saved.\nTake, for example, the directory at\nftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/\n.  If you retrieve it with\n-r\n,\nit will be saved locally under\nftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/\n.\nWhile the\n-nH\noption can remove the\nftp.xemacs.org/\npart, you\nare still stuck with\npub/xemacs\n.  This is where\n--cut-dirs\ncomes in handy; it makes Wget not \"see\"\nnumber\nremote\ndirectory components.  Here are several examples of how\n--cut-dirs\noption works.\nNo options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/\n-nH               -> pub/xemacs/\n-nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/\n-nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .\n--cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/\n...\nIf you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this\noption is similar to a combination of\n-nd\nand\n-P\n.  However,\nunlike\n-nd\n,\n--cut-dirs\ndoes not lose with subdirectories---for\ninstance, with\n-nH --cut-dirs=1\n, a\nbeta/\nsubdirectory will be\nplaced to\nxemacs/beta\n, as one would expect.\n-P\nprefix\n--directory-prefix=\nprefix\nSet directory prefix to\nprefix\n.  The\ndirectory prefix\nis the\ndirectory where all other files and subdirectories will be\nsaved to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is\n.\n(the current directory).\nHTTP Options\n--default-page=\nname\nUse\nname\nas the default file name when it isn't known (i.e.,\nfor URLs that end in a slash), instead of\nindex.html\n.\n-E\n--adjust-extension\nIf a file of type\napplication/xhtml+xml\nor\ntext/html\nis\ndownloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp\n\\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?\n, this option will cause the suffix\n.html\nto be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for\ninstance, when you're mirroring a remote site that uses\n.asp\npages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on your\nstock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when you're\ndownloading CGI-generated materials.  A URL like\nhttp://site.com/article.cgi?25\nwill be saved as\narticle.cgi?25.html\n.\nNote that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded\nevery time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that\nthe local\nX.html\nfile corresponds to remote URL\nX\n(since it\ndoesn't yet know that the URL produces output of type\ntext/html\nor\napplication/xhtml+xml\n.\nAs of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded\nfiles of type\ntext/css\nend in the suffix\n.css\n, and the option\nwas renamed from\n--html-extension\n, to better reflect its new\nbehavior. The old option name is still acceptable, but should\nnow be considered deprecated.\nAs of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any\ndownloaded files with a \"Content-Encoding\" of\nbr\n,\ncompress\n,\ndeflate\nor\ngzip\nend in the suffix\n.br\n,\n.Z\n,\n.zlib\nand\n.gz\nrespectively.\nAt some point in the future, this option may well be expanded\nto include suffixes for other types of content, including\ncontent types that are not parsed by Wget.\n--http-user=\nuser\n--http-password=\npassword\nSpecify the username\nuser\nand password\npassword\non an HTTP\nserver.  According to the type of the challenge, Wget will\nencode them using either the \"basic\" (insecure), the \"digest\",\nor the Windows \"NTLM\" authentication scheme.\nAnother way to specify username and password is in the URL\nitself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who\nbothers to run \"ps\".  To prevent the passwords from being\nseen, use the\n--use-askpass\nor store them in\n.wgetrc\nor\n.netrc\n, and make sure to protect those files from other users\nwith \"chmod\".  If the passwords are really important, do not\nleave them lying in those files either---edit the files and\ndelete them after Wget has started the download.\n--no-http-keep-alive\nTurn off the \"keep-alive\" feature for HTTP downloads.\nNormally, Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so\nthat, when you download more than one document from the same\nserver, they get transferred over the same TCP connection.\nThis saves time and at the same time reduces the load on the\nserver.\nThis option is useful when, for some reason, persistent\n(keep-alive) connections don't work for you, for example due\nto a server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts\nto cope with the connections.\n--no-cache\nDisable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the\nremote server appropriate directives (\nCache-Control: no-cache\nand\nPragma: no-cache\n) to get the file from the remote service,\nrather than returning the cached version. This is especially\nuseful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on\nproxy servers.\nCaching is allowed by default.\n--no-cookies\nDisable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for\nmaintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a\ncookie using the \"Set-Cookie\" header, and the client responds\nwith the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies\nallow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for\nsites to exchange this information, some consider them a\nbreach of privacy.  The default is to use cookies; however,\nstoring\ncookies is not on by default.\n--load-cookies\nfile\nLoad cookies from\nfile\nbefore the first HTTP retrieval.\nfile\nis a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's\ncookies.txt\nfile.\nYou will typically use this option when mirroring sites that\nrequire that you be logged in to access some or all of their\ncontent.  The login process typically works by the web server\nissuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your\ncredentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when\naccessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.\nMirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies\nyour browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is\nachieved by\n--load-cookies\n---simply point Wget to the location\nof the\ncookies.txt\nfile, and it will send the same cookies\nyour browser would send in the same situation.  Different\nbrowsers keep textual cookie files in different locations:\n\"Netscape 4.x.\"\nThe cookies are in\n~/.netscape/cookies.txt\n.\n\"Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.\"\nMozilla's cookie file is also named\ncookies.txt\n, located\nsomewhere under\n~/.mozilla\n, in the directory of your\nprofile.  The full path usually ends up looking somewhat\nlike\n~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt\n.\n\"Internet Explorer.\"\nYou can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the\nFile menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has\nbeen tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed\nto work with earlier versions.\n\"Other browsers.\"\nIf you are using a different browser to create your\ncookies,\n--load-cookies\nwill only work if you can locate\nor produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget\nexpects.\nIf you cannot use\n--load-cookies\n, there might still be an\nalternative.  If your browser supports a \"cookie manager\", you\ncan use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site\nyou're mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the\ncookie, and manually instruct Wget to send those cookies,\nbypassing the \"official\" cookie support:\nwget --no-cookies --header \"Cookie: <name>=<value>\"\n--save-cookies\nfile\nSave cookies to\nfile\nbefore exiting.  This will not save\ncookies that have expired or that have no expiry time\n(so-called \"session cookies\"), but also see\n--keep-session-cookies\n.\n--keep-session-cookies\nWhen specified, causes\n--save-cookies\nto also save session\ncookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they\nare meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the\nbrowser.  Saving them is useful on sites that require you to\nlog in or to visit the home page before you can access some\npages.  With this option, multiple Wget runs are considered a\nsingle browser session as far as the site is concerned.\nSince the cookie file format does not normally carry session\ncookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.\nWget's\n--load-cookies\nrecognizes those as session cookies, but\nit might confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so\nloaded will be treated as other session cookies, which means\nthat if you want\n--save-cookies\nto preserve them again, you\nmust use\n--keep-session-cookies\nagain.\n--ignore-length\nUnfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more\nprecise) send out bogus \"Content-Length\" headers, which makes\nWget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.\nYou can spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same\ndocument again and again, each time claiming that the\n(otherwise normal) connection has closed on the very same\nbyte.\nWith this option, Wget will ignore the \"Content-Length\"\nheader---as if it never existed.\n--header=\nheader-line\nSend\nheader-line\nalong with the rest of the headers in each\nHTTP request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means\nit must contain name and value separated by colon, and must\nnot contain newlines.\nYou may define more than one additional header by specifying\n--header\nmore than once.\nwget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \\\n--header='Accept-Language: hr'        \\\nhttp://fly.srk.fer.hr/\nSpecification of an empty string as the header value will\nclear all previous user-defined headers.\nAs of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers\notherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs\nWget to connect to localhost, but to specify\nfoo.bar\nin the\n\"Host\" header:\nwget --header=\"Host: foo.bar\"\nhttp://localhost/\nIn versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of\n--header\ncaused\nsending of duplicate headers.\n--compression=\ntype\nChoose the type of compression to be used.  Legal values are\nauto\n,\ngzip\nand\nnone\n.\nIf\nauto\nor\ngzip\nare specified, Wget asks the server to\ncompress the file using the gzip compression format. If the\nserver compresses the file and responds with the\n\"Content-Encoding\" header field set appropriately, the file\nwill be decompressed automatically.\nIf\nnone\nis specified, wget will not ask the server to compress\nthe file and will not decompress any server responses. This is\nthe default.\nCompression support is currently experimental. In case it is\nturned on, please report any bugs to \"bug-wget@gnu.org\".\n--max-redirect=\nnumber\nSpecifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a\nresource.  The default is 20, which is usually far more than\nnecessary. However, on those occasions where you want to allow\nmore (or fewer), this is the option to use.\n--proxy-user=\nuser\n--proxy-password=\npassword\nSpecify the username\nuser\nand password\npassword\nfor\nauthentication on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using\nthe \"basic\" authentication scheme.\nSecurity considerations similar to those with\n--http-password\npertain here as well.\n--referer=\nurl\nInclude `Referer:\nurl\n' header in HTTP request.  Useful for\nretrieving documents with server-side processing that assume\nthey are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers\nand only come out properly when Referer is set to one of the\npages that point to them.\n--save-headers\nSave the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file,\npreceding the actual contents, with an empty line as the\nseparator.\n-U\nagent-string\n--user-agent=\nagent-string\nIdentify as\nagent-string\nto the HTTP server.\nThe HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves\nusing a \"User-Agent\" header field.  This enables\ndistinguishing the WWW software, usually for statistical\npurposes or for tracing of protocol violations.  Wget normally\nidentifies as\nWget/\nversion\n,\nversion\nbeing the current version\nnumber of Wget.\nHowever, some sites have been known to impose the policy of\ntailoring the output according to the \"User-Agent\"-supplied\ninformation.  While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it\nhas been abused by servers denying information to clients\nother than (historically) Netscape or, more frequently,\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer.  This option allows you to change\nthe \"User-Agent\" line issued by Wget.  Use of this option is\ndiscouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.\nSpecifying empty user agent with\n--user-agent=\"\"\ninstructs\nWget not to send the \"User-Agent\" header in HTTP requests.\n--post-data=\nstring\n--post-file=\nfile\nUse POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the\nspecified data in the request body.\n--post-data\nsends\nstring\nas data, whereas\n--post-file\nsends the contents of\nfile\n.\nOther than that, they work in exactly the same way. In\nparticular, they\nboth\nexpect content of the form\n\"key1=value1&key2=value2\", with percent-encoding for special\ncharacters; the only difference is that one expects its\ncontent as a command-line parameter and the other accepts its\ncontent from a file. In particular,\n--post-file\nis\nnot\nfor\ntransmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as\n\"key=value\" data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like\neverything else. Wget does not currently support\n\"multipart/form-data\" for transmitting POST data; only\n\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\". Only one of\n--post-data\nand\n--post-file\nshould be specified.\nPlease note that wget does not require the content to be of\nthe form \"key1=value1&key2=value2\", and neither does it test\nfor it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to\nit. Most servers however expect the POST data to be in the\nabove format when processing HTML Forms.\nWhen sending a POST request using the\n--post-file\noption, Wget\ntreats the file as a binary file and will send every character\nin the POST request without stripping trailing newline or\nformfeed characters. Any other control characters in the text\nwill also be sent as-is in the POST request.\nPlease be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST\ndata in advance.  Therefore the argument to \"--post-file\" must\nbe a regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like\n/dev/stdin\nwon't work.  It's not quite clear how to work\naround this limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0.  Although\nHTTP/1.1 introduces\nchunked\ntransfer that doesn't require\nknowing the request length in advance, a client can't use\nchunked unless it knows it's talking to an HTTP/1.1 server.\nAnd it can't know that until it receives a response, which in\nturn requires the request to have been completed -- a\nchicken-and-egg problem.\nNote: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST\nrequest is completed, its behaviour will depend on the\nresponse code returned by the server.  In case of a 301 Moved\nPermanently, 302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect,\nWget will, in accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a POST\nrequest.  In case a server wants the client to change the\nRequest method upon redirection, it should send a 303 See\nOther response code.\nThis example shows how to log in to a server using POST and\nthen proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only\naccessible to authorized users:\n# Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.\nwget --save-cookies cookies.txt \\\n--post-data 'user=foo&password=bar' \\\nhttp://example.com/auth.php\n# Now grab the page or pages we care about.\nwget --load-cookies cookies.txt \\\n-p\nhttp://example.com/interesting/article.php\nIf the server is using session cookies to track user\nauthentication, the above will not work because\n--save-cookies\nwill not save them (and neither will browsers) and the\ncookies.txt\nfile will be empty.  In that case use\n--keep-session-cookies\nalong with\n--save-cookies\nto force\nsaving of session cookies.\n--method=\nHTTP-Method\nFor the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of\nother HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly set them\nusing\n--header=Header-Line\n.  Wget will use whatever string is\npassed to it after\n--method\nas the HTTP Method to the server.\n--body-data=\nData-String\n--body-file=\nData-File\nMust be set when additional data needs to be sent to the\nserver along with the Method specified using\n--method\n.\n--body-data\nsends\nstring\nas data, whereas\n--body-file\nsends\nthe contents of\nfile\n.  Other than that, they work in exactly\nthe same way.\nCurrently,\n--body-file\nis\nnot\nfor transmitting files as a\nwhole.  Wget does not currently support \"multipart/form-data\"\nfor transmitting data; only\n\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\". In the future, this may\nbe changed so that wget sends the\n--body-file\nas a complete\nfile instead of sending its contents to the server. Please be\naware that Wget needs to know the contents of BODY Data in\nadvance, and hence the argument to\n--body-file\nshould be a\nregular file. See\n--post-file\nfor a more detailed explanation.\nOnly one of\n--body-data\nand\n--body-file\nshould be specified.\nIf Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget\nwill suspend the current method and send a GET request till\nthe redirection is completed.  This is true for all\nredirection response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which\nis used to explicitly specify that the request method should\nnot\nchange.  Another exception is when the method is set to\n\"POST\", in which case the redirection rules specified under\n--post-data\nare followed.\n--content-disposition\nIf this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional)\nsupport for \"Content-Disposition\" headers is enabled. This can\ncurrently result in extra round-trips to the server for a\n\"HEAD\" request, and is known to suffer from a few bugs, which\nis why it is not currently enabled by default.\nThis option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs\nthat use \"Content-Disposition\" headers to describe what the\nname of a downloaded file should be.\nWhen combined with\n--metalink-over-http\nand\n--trust-server-names\n, a\nContent-Type:\napplication/metalink4+xml\nfile is named using the\n\"Content-Disposition\" filename field, if available.\n--content-on-error\nIf this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when the\nserver responds with a http status code that indicates error.\n--trust-server-names\nIf this is set, on a redirect, the local file name will be\nbased on the redirection URL.  By default the local file name\nis based on the original URL.  When doing recursive retrieving\nthis can be helpful because in many web sites redirected URLs\ncorrespond to an underlying file structure, while link URLs do\nnot.\n--auth-no-challenge\nIf this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP\nauthentication information (plaintext username and password)\nfor all requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by\ndefault.\nUse of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to\nsupport some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP\nauthentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info,\nsay, in addition to form-based authentication.\n--retry-on-host-error\nConsider host errors, such as \"Temporary failure in name\nresolution\", as non-fatal, transient errors.\n--retry-on-http-error=\ncode[,code,...]\nConsider given HTTP response codes as non-fatal, transient\nerrors.  Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit HTTP\nresponse codes as argument. Useful to work around special\ncircumstances where retries are required, but the server\nresponds with an error code normally not retried by Wget. Such\nerrors might be 503 (Service Unavailable) and 429 (Too Many\nRequests). Retries enabled by this option are performed\nsubject to the normal retry timing and retry count limitations\nof Wget.\nUsing this option is intended to support special use cases\nonly and is generally not recommended, as it can force retries\neven in cases where the server is actually trying to decrease\nits load. Please use wisely and only if you know what you are\ndoing.\nHTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options\nTo support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled\nwith an external SSL library. The current default is GnuTLS.  In\naddition, Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport\nSecurity).  If Wget is compiled without SSL support, none of these\noptions are available.\n--secure-protocol=\nprotocol\nChoose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are\nauto\n,\nSSLv2\n,\nSSLv3\n,\nTLSv1\n,\nTLSv1_1\n,\nTLSv1_2\n,\nTLSv1_3\nand\nPFS\n.  If\nauto\nis used, the SSL library is given the liberty of choosing\nthe appropriate protocol automatically, which is achieved by\nsending a TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.\nSpecifying\nSSLv2\n,\nSSLv3\n,\nTLSv1\n,\nTLSv1_1\n,\nTLSv1_2\nor\nTLSv1_3\nforces the use of the corresponding protocol.  This is useful\nwhen talking to old and buggy SSL server implementations that\nmake it hard for the underlying SSL library to choose the\ncorrect protocol version.  Fortunately, such servers are quite\nrare.\nSpecifying\nPFS\nenforces the use of the so-called Perfect\nForward Security cipher suites. In short, PFS adds security by\ncreating a one-time key for each SSL connection. It has a bit\nmore CPU impact on client and server.  We use known to be\nsecure ciphers (e.g. no MD4) and the TLS protocol. This mode\nalso explicitly excludes non-PFS key exchange methods, such as\nRSA.\n--https-only\nWhen in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.\n--ciphers\nSet the cipher list string. Typically this string sets the\ncipher suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish\nshould be used, in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it\n'priority string'). This string will be fed verbatim to the\nSSL/TLS engine (OpenSSL or GnuTLS) and hence its format and\nsyntax is dependent on that. Wget will not process or\nmanipulate it in any way. Refer to the OpenSSL or GnuTLS\ndocumentation for more information.\n--no-check-certificate\nDon't check the server certificate against the available\ncertificate authorities.  Also don't require the URL host name\nto match the common name presented by the certificate.\nAs of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's\ncertificate against the recognized certificate authorities,\nbreaking the SSL handshake and aborting the download if the\nverification fails.  Although this provides more secure\ndownloads, it does break interoperability with some sites that\nworked with previous Wget versions, particularly those using\nself-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid certificates.  This\noption forces an \"insecure\" mode of operation that turns the\ncertificate verification errors into warnings and allows you\nto proceed.\nIf you encounter \"certificate verification\" errors or ones\nsaying that \"common name doesn't match requested host name\",\nyou can use this option to bypass the verification and proceed\nwith the download.\nOnly use this option if you are otherwise\nconvinced of the site's authenticity, or if you really don't\ncare about the validity of its certificate.\nIt is almost\nalways a bad idea not to check the certificates when\ntransmitting confidential or important data.  For\nself-signed/internal certificates, you should download the\ncertificate and verify against that instead of forcing this\ninsecure mode.  If you are really sure of not desiring any\ncertificate verification, you can specify\n--check-certificate=quiet to tell wget to not print any\nwarning about invalid certificates, albeit in most cases this\nis the wrong thing to do.\n--certificate=\nfile\nUse the client certificate stored in\nfile\n.  This is needed for\nservers that are configured to require certificates from the\nclients that connect to them.  Normally a certificate is not\nrequired and this switch is optional.\n--certificate-type=\ntype\nSpecify the type of the client certificate.  Legal values are\nPEM\n(assumed by default) and\nDER\n, also known as\nASN1\n.\n--private-key=\nfile\nRead the private key from\nfile\n.  This allows you to provide\nthe private key in a file separate from the certificate.\n--private-key-type=\ntype\nSpecify the type of the private key.  Accepted values are\nPEM\n(the default) and\nDER\n.\n--ca-certificate=\nfile\nUse\nfile\nas the file with the bundle of certificate\nauthorities (\"CA\") to verify the peers.  The certificates must\nbe in PEM format.\nWithout this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the\nsystem-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation\ntime.\n--ca-directory=\ndirectory\nSpecifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.\nEach file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is\nbased on a hash value derived from the certificate.  This is\nachieved by processing a certificate directory with the\n\"c_rehash\" utility supplied with OpenSSL.  Using\n--ca-directory\nis more efficient than\n--ca-certificate\nwhen\nmany certificates are installed because it allows Wget to\nfetch certificates on demand.\nWithout this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the\nsystem-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation\ntime.\n--crl-file=\nfile\nSpecifies a CRL file in\nfile\n.  This is needed for certificates\nthat have been revocated by the CAs.\n--pinnedpubkey=file/hashes\nTells wget to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to\nverify the peer.  This can be a path to a file which contains\na single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of\nbase64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by \"sha256//\" and\nseparated by \";\"\nWhen negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a\ncertificate indicating its identity. A public key is extracted\nfrom this certificate and if it does not exactly match the\npublic key(s) provided to this option, wget will abort the\nconnection before sending or receiving any data.\n--random-file=\nfile\n[OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use\nfile\nas the source of random\ndata for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on systems\nwithout\n/dev/urandom\n.\nOn such systems the SSL library needs an external source of\nrandomness to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by EGD\n(see\n--egd-file\nbelow) or read from an external source\nspecified by the user.  If this option is not specified, Wget\nlooks for random data in $RANDFILE or, if that is unset, in\n$HOME/.rnd\n.\nIf you're getting the \"Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling\nSSL.\"  error, you should provide random data using some of the\nmethods described above.\n--egd-file=\nfile\n[OpenSSL only] Use\nfile\nas the EGD socket.  EGD stands for\nEntropy Gathering Daemon\n, a user-space program that collects\ndata from various unpredictable system sources and makes it\navailable to other programs that might need it.  Encryption\nsoftware, such as the SSL library, needs sources of\nnon-repeating randomness to seed the random number generator\nused to produce cryptographically strong keys.\nOpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy\nusing the \"RAND_FILE\" environment variable.  If this variable\nis unset, or if the specified file does not produce enough\nrandomness, OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket\nspecified using this option.\nIf this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup\ncommand is not used), EGD is never contacted.  EGD is not\nneeded on modern Unix systems that support\n/dev/urandom\n.\n--no-hsts\nWget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security, RFC 6797)\nby default.  Use\n--no-hsts\nto make Wget act as a\nnon-HSTS-compliant UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all\nthe \"Strict-Transport-Security\" headers, and would not enforce\nany existing HSTS policy.\n--hsts-file=\nfile\nBy default, Wget stores its HSTS database in\n~/.wget-hsts\n.\nYou can use\n--hsts-file\nto override this. Wget will use the\nsupplied file as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to\nthe correct HSTS database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot\nparse the provided file, the behaviour is unspecified.\nThe Wget's HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line\ncontains an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a\n\"Strict-Transport-Security\" header and that therefore has\nspecified a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines\nstarting with a dash (\"#\") are ignored by Wget. Please note\nthat in spite of this convenient human-readability\nhand-hacking the HSTS database is generally not a good idea.\nAn HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one\nor more whitespace:\n\"<hostname> SP [<port>] SP <include subdomains> SP <created>\nSP <max-age>\"\nThe\nhostname\nand\nport\nfields indicate the hostname and port to\nwhich the given HSTS policy applies. The\nport\nfield may be\nzero, and it will, in most of the cases. That means that the\nport number will not be taken into account when deciding\nwhether such HSTS policy should be applied on a given request\n(only the hostname will be evaluated). When\nport\nis different\nto zero, both the target hostname and the port will be\nevaluated and the HSTS policy will only be applied if both of\nthem match. This feature has been included for\ntesting/development purposes only.  The Wget testsuite (in\ntestenv/\n) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the\npurpose of ensuring Wget's correct behaviour. Applying HSTS\npolicies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged\nby RFC 6797 (see Appendix B \"Differences between HSTS Policy\nand Same-Origin Policy\"). Thus, this functionality should not\nbe used in production environments and\nport\nwill typically be\nzero. The last three fields do what they are expected to. The\nfield\ninclude_subdomains\ncan either be 1 or 0 and it signals\nwhether the subdomains of the target domain should be part of\nthe given HSTS policy as well. The\ncreated\nand\nmax-age\nfields\nhold the timestamp values of when such entry was created\n(first seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined value 'max-age',\nwhich states how long should that HSTS policy remain active,\nmeasured in seconds elapsed since the timestamp stored in\ncreated\n. Once that time has passed, that HSTS policy will no\nlonger be valid and will eventually be removed from the\ndatabase.\nIf you supply your own HSTS database via\n--hsts-file\n, be aware\nthat Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs\nbetween the HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and\nthose in the file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates the\nHSTS database by rewriting the database file with the new\nentries.\nIf the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one.\nThis file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS\nentries were generated (no \"Strict-Transport-Security\" headers\nwere sent by any of the servers) then no file will be created,\nnot even an empty one. This behaviour applies to the default\ndatabase file (\n~/.wget-hsts\n) as well: it will not be created\nuntil some server enforces an HSTS policy.\nCare is taken not to override possible changes made by other\nWget processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before\ndumping the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will\nre-read it and merge the changes.\nUsing a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one\nis discouraged.  For more information about the potential\nsecurity threats arose from such practice, see section 14\n\"Security Considerations\" of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9\n\"Creative Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store\".\n--warc-file=\nfile\nUse\nfile\nas the destination WARC file.\n--warc-header=\nstring\nUse\nstring\ninto as the warcinfo record.\n--warc-max-size=\nsize\nSet the maximum size of the WARC files to\nsize\n.\n--warc-cdx\nWrite CDX index files.\n--warc-dedup=\nfile\nDo not store records listed in this CDX file.\n--no-warc-compression\nDo not compress WARC files with GZIP.\n--no-warc-digests\nDo not calculate SHA1 digests.\n--no-warc-keep-log\nDo not store the log file in a WARC record.\n--warc-tempdir=\ndir\nSpecify the location for temporary files created by the WARC\nwriter.\nFTP Options\n--ftp-user=\nuser\n--ftp-password=\npassword\nSpecify the username\nuser\nand password\npassword\non an FTP\nserver.  Without this, or the corresponding startup option,\nthe password defaults to\n-wget@\n, normally used for anonymous\nFTP.\nAnother way to specify username and password is in the URL\nitself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who\nbothers to run \"ps\".  To prevent the passwords from being\nseen, store them in\n.wgetrc\nor\n.netrc\n, and make sure to\nprotect those files from other users with \"chmod\".  If the\npasswords are really important, do not leave them lying in\nthose files either---edit the files and delete them after Wget\nhas started the download.\n--no-remove-listing\nDon't remove the temporary\n.listing\nfiles generated by FTP\nretrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory\nlistings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be\nuseful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to\neasily check on the contents of remote server directories\n(e.g. to verify that a mirror you're running is complete).\nNote that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this\nfile, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user\nmaking\n.listing\na symbolic link to\n/etc/passwd\nor something\nand asking \"root\" to run Wget in his or her directory.\nDepending on the options used, either Wget will refuse to\nwrite to\n.listing\n, making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping\noperation fail, or the symbolic link will be deleted and\nreplaced with the actual\n.listing\nfile, or the listing will be\nwritten to a\n.listing.number\nfile.\nEven though this situation isn't a problem, though, \"root\"\nshould never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A\nuser could do something as simple as linking\nindex.html\nto\n/etc/passwd\nand asking \"root\" to run Wget with\n-N\nor\n-r\nso the\nfile will be overwritten.\n--no-glob\nTurn off FTP globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of\nshell-like special characters (\nwildcards\n), like\n*\n,\n?\n,\n[\nand\n]\nto retrieve more than one file from the same directory at\nonce, like:\nwget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg\nBy default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a\nglobbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing\non or off permanently.\nYou may have to quote the URL to protect it from being\nexpanded by your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a\ndirectory listing, which is system-specific.  This is why it\ncurrently works only with Unix FTP servers (and the ones\nemulating Unix \"ls\" output).\n--no-passive-ftp\nDisable the use of the\npassive\nFTP transfer mode.  Passive FTP\nmandates that the client connect to the server to establish\nthe data connection rather than the other way around.\nIf the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both\npassive and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most\nfirewall and NAT configurations passive FTP has a better\nchance of working.  However, in some rare firewall\nconfigurations, active FTP actually works when passive FTP\ndoesn't.  If you suspect this to be the case, use this option,\nor set \"passive_ftp=off\" in your init file.\n--preserve-permissions\nPreserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set by\numask.\n--retr-symlinks\nBy default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a\nsymbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed\nand the pointed-to files are retrieved.  Currently, Wget does\nnot traverse symbolic links to directories to download them\nrecursively, though this feature may be added in the future.\nWhen\n--retr-symlinks=no\nis specified, the linked-to file is\nnot downloaded.  Instead, a matching symbolic link is created\non the local file system.  The pointed-to file will not be\nretrieved unless this recursive retrieval would have\nencountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.  This\noption poses a security risk where a malicious FTP Server may\ncause Wget to write to files outside of the intended\ndirectories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.\nNote that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it\nwas specified on the command-line, rather than because it was\nrecursed to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are\nalways traversed in this case.\nFTPS Options\n--ftps-implicit\nThis option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly. Implicit FTPS\nconsists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of\nthe control connection. This option does not send an \"AUTH\nTLS\" command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly\nstarts an SSL/TLS connection. If the attempt is successful,\nthe session continues just like regular FTPS (\"PBSZ\" and\n\"PROT\" are sent, etc.).  Implicit FTPS is no longer a\nrequirement for FTPS implementations, and thus many servers\nmay not support it. If\n--ftps-implicit\nis passed and no\nexplicit port number specified, the default port for implicit\nFTPS, 990, will be used, instead of the default port for the\n\"normal\" (explicit) FTPS which is the same as that of FTP, 21.\n--no-ftps-resume-ssl\nDo not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel. When\nstarting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS\nsession previously started in the control connection.  SSL/TLS\nsession resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake\nby reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous session.\nTypically, the FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget does\nthis by default. Under rare circumstances however, one might\nwant to start an entirely new SSL/TLS session in every data\nconnection.  This is what\n--no-ftps-resume-ssl\nis for.\n--ftps-clear-data-connection\nAll the data connections will be in plain text. Only the\ncontrol connection will be under SSL/TLS. Wget will send a\n\"PROT C\" command to achieve this, which must be approved by\nthe server.\n--ftps-fallback-to-ftp\nFall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by the target\nserver. For security reasons, this option is not asserted by\ndefault. The default behaviour is to exit with an error.  If a\nserver does not successfully reply to the initial \"AUTH TLS\"\ncommand, or in the case of implicit FTPS, if the initial\nSSL/TLS connection attempt is rejected, it is considered that\nsuch server does not support FTPS.\nRecursive Retrieval Options\n-r\n--recursive\nTurn on recursive retrieving.    The default maximum depth is\n5.\n-l\ndepth\n--level=\ndepth\nSet the maximum number of subdirectories that Wget will\nrecurse into to\ndepth\n.  In order to prevent one from\naccidentally downloading very large websites when using\nrecursion this is limited to a depth of 5 by default, i.e., it\nwill traverse at most 5 directories deep starting from the\nprovided URL.  Set\n-l 0\nor\n-l inf\nfor infinite recursion\ndepth.\nwget -r -l 0\nhttp://<site>/1.html\nIdeally, one would expect this to download just\n1.html\n.  but\nunfortunately this is not the case, because\n-l 0\nis equivalent\nto\n-l inf\n---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single\nHTML page (or a handful of them), specify them all on the\ncommand line and leave away\n-r\nand\n-l\n. To download the\nessential items to view a single HTML page, see\npage\nrequisites\n.\n--delete-after\nThis option tells Wget to delete every single file it\ndownloads,\nafter\nhaving done so.  It is useful for\npre-fetching popular pages through a proxy, e.g.:\nwget -r -nd --delete-after\nhttp://whatever.com/~popular/page/\nThe\n-r\noption is to retrieve recursively, and\n-nd\nto not\ncreate directories.\nNote that\n--delete-after\ndeletes files on the local machine.\nIt does not issue the\nDELE\ncommand to remote FTP sites, for\ninstance.  Also note that when\n--delete-after\nis specified,\n--convert-links\nis ignored, so\n.orig\nfiles are simply not\ncreated in the first place.\n-k\n--convert-links\nAfter the download is complete, convert the links in the\ndocument to make them suitable for local viewing.  This\naffects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any part of the\ndocument that links to external content, such as embedded\nimages, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML content,\netc.\nEach link will be changed in one of the two ways:\nâ¢   The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will\nbe changed to refer to the file they point to as a\nrelative link.\nExample: if the downloaded file\n/foo/doc.html\nlinks to\n/bar/img.gif\n, also downloaded, then the link in\ndoc.html\nwill be modified to point to\n../bar/img.gif\n.  This kind of\ntransformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations\nof directories.\nâ¢   The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget\nwill be changed to include host name and absolute path of\nthe location they point to.\nExample: if the downloaded file\n/foo/doc.html\nlinks to\n/bar/img.gif\n(or to\n../bar/img.gif\n), then the link in\ndoc.html\nwill be modified to point to\nhttp://hostname/bar/img.gif\n.\nBecause of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked\nfile was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if\nit was not downloaded, the link will refer to its full\nInternet address rather than presenting a broken link.  The\nfact that the former links are converted to relative links\nensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another\ndirectory.\nNote that only at the end of the download can Wget know which\nlinks have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by\n-k\nwill be performed at the end of all the downloads.\n--convert-file-only\nThis option converts only the filename part of the URLs,\nleaving the rest of the URLs untouched. This filename part is\nsometimes referred to as the \"basename\", although we avoid\nthat term here in order not to cause confusion.\nIt works particularly well in conjunction with\n--adjust-extension\n, although this coupling is not enforced. It\nproves useful to populate Internet caches with files\ndownloaded from different hosts.\nExample: if some link points to\n//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz\nwith\n--adjust-extension\nasserted and its local destination is\nintended to be\n./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css\n, then the link would\nbe converted to\n//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css\n. Note that only the\nfilename part has been modified. The rest of the URL has been\nleft untouched, including the net path (\"//\") which would\notherwise be processed by Wget and converted to the effective\nscheme (ie. \"http://\").\n-K\n--backup-converted\nWhen converting a file, back up the original version with a\n.orig\nsuffix.  Affects the behavior of\n-N\n.\n-m\n--mirror\nTurn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on\nrecursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and\nkeeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to\n-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing\n.\n-p\n--page-requisites\nThis option causes Wget to download all the files that are\nnecessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This\nincludes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced\nstylesheets.\nOrdinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite\ndocuments that may be needed to display it properly are not\ndownloaded.  Using\n-r\ntogether with\n-l\ncan help, but since\nWget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and\ninlined documents, one is generally left with \"leaf documents\"\nthat are missing their requisites.\nFor instance, say document\n1.html\ncontains an \"<IMG>\" tag\nreferencing\n1.gif\nand an \"<A>\" tag pointing to external\ndocument\n2.html\n.  Say that\n2.html\nis similar but that its\nimage is\n2.gif\nand it links to\n3.html\n.  Say this continues up\nto some arbitrarily high number.\nIf one executes the command:\nwget -r -l 2\nhttp://<site>/1.html\nthen\n1.html\n,\n1.gif\n,\n2.html\n,\n2.gif\n, and\n3.html\nwill be\ndownloaded.  As you can see,\n3.html\nis without its requisite\n3.gif\nbecause Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up\nto 2) away from\n1.html\nin order to determine where to stop the\nrecursion.  However, with this command:\nwget -r -l 2 -p\nhttp://<site>/1.html\nall the above files\nand 3.html\n's requisite\n3.gif\nwill be\ndownloaded.  Similarly,\nwget -r -l 1 -p\nhttp://<site>/1.html\nwill cause\n1.html\n,\n1.gif\n,\n2.html\n, and\n2.gif\nto be downloaded.\nOne might think that:\nwget -r -l 0 -p\nhttp://<site>/1.html\nwould download just\n1.html\nand\n1.gif\n, but unfortunately this\nis not the case, because\n-l 0\nis equivalent to\n-l inf\n---that\nis, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a\nhandful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a\n-i\nURL input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave\noff\n-r\nand\n-l\n:\nwget -p\nhttp://<site>/1.html\nNote that Wget will behave as if\n-r\nhad been specified, but\nonly that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.\nLinks from that page to external documents will not be\nfollowed.  Actually, to download a single page and all its\nrequisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and make\nsure the lot displays properly locally, this author likes to\nuse a few options in addition to\n-p\n:\nwget -E -H -k -K -p\nhttp://<site>/<document>\nTo finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea\nof an external document link is any URL specified in an \"<A>\"\ntag, an \"<AREA>\" tag, or a \"<LINK>\" tag other than \"<LINK\nREL=\"stylesheet\">\".\n--strict-comments\nTurn on strict parsing of HTML comments.  The default is to\nterminate comments at the first occurrence of\n-->\n.\nAccording to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as\nSGML\ndeclarations\n.  Declaration is special markup that begins\nwith\n<!\nand ends with\n>\n, such as\n<!DOCTYPE ...>\n, that may\ncontain comments between a pair of\n--\ndelimiters.  HTML\ncomments are \"empty declarations\", SGML declarations without\nany non-comment text.  Therefore,\n<!--foo-->\nis a valid\ncomment, and so is\n<!--one-- --two-->\n, but\n<!--1--2-->\nis not.\nOn the other hand, most HTML writers don't perceive comments\nas anything other than text delimited with\n<!--\nand\n-->\n, which\nis not quite the same.  For example, something like\n<!------------>\nworks as a valid comment as long as the number\nof dashes is a multiple of four (!).  If not, the comment\ntechnically lasts until the next\n--\n, which may be at the other\nend of the document.  Because of this, many popular browsers\ncompletely ignore the specification and implement what users\nhave come to expect: comments delimited with\n<!--\nand\n-->\n.\nUntil version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which\nresulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed\nfine in browsers, but had the misfortune of containing\nnon-compliant comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has\njoined the ranks of clients that implements \"naive\" comments,\nterminating each comment at the first occurrence of\n-->\n.\nIf, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use\nthis option to turn it on.\nRecursive Accept/Reject Options\n-A\nacclist\n--accept\nacclist\n-R\nrejlist\n--reject\nrejlist\nSpecify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or\npatterns to accept or reject. Note that if any of the wildcard\ncharacters,\n*\n,\n?\n,\n[\nor\n]\n, appear in an element of\nacclist\nor\nrejlist\n, it will be treated as a pattern, rather than a\nsuffix.  In this case, you have to enclose the pattern into\nquotes to prevent your shell from expanding it, like in\n-A\n\"*.mp3\"\nor\n-A '*.mp3'\n.\n--accept-regex\nurlregex\n--reject-regex\nurlregex\nSpecify a regular expression to accept or reject the complete\nURL.\n--regex-type\nregextype\nSpecify the regular expression type.  Possible types are\nposix\nor\npcre\n.  Note that to be able to use\npcre\ntype, wget has to\nbe compiled with libpcre support.\n-D\ndomain-list\n--domains=\ndomain-list\nSet domains to be followed.\ndomain-list\nis a comma-separated\nlist of domains.  Note that it does\nnot\nturn on\n-H\n.\n--exclude-domains\ndomain-list\nSpecify the domains that are\nnot\nto be followed.\n--follow-ftp\nFollow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option,\nWget will ignore all the FTP links.\n--follow-tags=\nlist\nWget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that\nit considers when looking for linked documents during a\nrecursive retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those\ntags to be considered, however, he or she should be specify\nsuch tags in a comma-separated\nlist\nwith this option.\n--ignore-tags=\nlist\nThis is the opposite of the\n--follow-tags\noption.  To skip\ncertain HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to\ndownload, specify them in a comma-separated\nlist\n.\nIn the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a\nsingle page and its requisites, using a command-line like:\nwget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r\nhttp://<site>/<document>\nHowever, the author of this option came across a page with\ntags like \"<LINK REL=\"home\" HREF=\"/\">\" and came to the\nrealization that specifying tags to ignore was not enough.\nOne can't just tell Wget to ignore \"<LINK>\", because then\nstylesheets will not be downloaded.  Now the best bet for\ndownloading a single page and its requisites is the dedicated\n--page-requisites\noption.\n--ignore-case\nIgnore case when matching files and directories.  This\ninfluences the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well\nas globbing implemented when downloading from FTP sites.  For\nexample, with this option,\n-A \"*.txt\"\nwill match\nfile1.txt\n,\nbut also\nfile2.TXT\n,\nfile3.TxT\n, and so on.  The quotes in the\nexample are to prevent the shell from expanding the pattern.\n-H\n--span-hosts\nEnable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.\n-L\n--relative\nFollow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific\nhome page without any distractions, not even those from the\nsame hosts.\n-I\nlist\n--include-directories=\nlist\nSpecify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to\nfollow when downloading.  Elements of\nlist\nmay contain\nwildcards.\n-X\nlist\n--exclude-directories=\nlist\nSpecify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to\nexclude from download.  Elements of\nlist\nmay contain\nwildcards.\n-np\n--no-parent\nDo not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving\nrecursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees\nthat only the files\nbelow\na certain hierarchy will be\ndownloaded.\nENVIRONMENT\ntop\nWget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The\nstandard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is\nusing the following environment variables:\nhttp_proxy\nhttps_proxy\nIf set, the\nhttp_proxy\nand\nhttps_proxy\nvariables should\ncontain the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS connections\nrespectively.\nftp_proxy\nThis variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP\nconnections.  It is quite common that\nhttp_proxy\nand\nftp_proxy\nare set to the same URL.\nno_proxy\nThis variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain\nextensions proxy should\nnot\nbe used for.  For instance, if the\nvalue of\nno_proxy\nis\n.mit.edu\n, proxy will not be used to\nretrieve documents from MIT.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nWget may return one of several error codes if it encounters\nproblems.\n0   No problems occurred.\n1   Generic error code.\n2   Parse error---for instance, when parsing command-line options,\nthe\n.wgetrc\nor\n.netrc\n...\n3   File I/O error.\n4   Network failure.\n5   SSL verification failure.\n6   Username/password authentication failure.\n7   Protocol errors.\n8   Server issued an error response.\nWith the exceptions of 0 and 1, the lower-numbered exit codes take\nprecedence over higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of\nerrors are encountered.\nIn versions of Wget prior to 1.12, Wget's exit status tended to be\nunhelpful and inconsistent. Recursive downloads would virtually\nalways return 0 (success), regardless of any issues encountered,\nand non-recursive fetches only returned the status corresponding\nto the most recently-attempted download.\nFILES\ntop\n/usr/local/etc/wgetrc\nDefault location of the\nglobal\nstartup file.\n.wgetrc\nUser startup file.\nBUGS\ntop\nYou are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug tracker\n(see <\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&group=wget\n>) or\nto our mailing list <\nbug-wget@gnu.org\n>.\nVisit <\nhttps://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget\n> to get\nmore info (how to subscribe, list archives, ...).\nBefore actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a\nfew simple guidelines.\n1.  Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a\nbug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as\ndocumented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are\nnot sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might\nwell be a bug, but you might want to double-check the\ndocumentation and the mailing lists.\n2.  Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.\nE.g. if Wget crashes while downloading\nwget -rl0 -kKE -t5\n--no-proxy\nhttp://example.com\n-o /tmp/log\n, you should try to\nsee if the crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a\nsimpler set of options.  You might even try to start the\ndownload at the page where the crash occurred to see if that\npage somehow triggered the crash.\nAlso, while I will probably be interested to know the contents\nof your\n.wgetrc\nfile, just dumping it into the debug message\nis probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see\nif the bug repeats with\n.wgetrc\nmoved out of the way.  Only if\nit turns out that\n.wgetrc\nsettings affect the bug, mail me the\nrelevant parts of the file.\n3.  Please start Wget with\n-d\noption and send us the resulting\noutput (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled\nwithout debug support, recompile it---it is\nmuch\neasier to\ntrace bugs with debug support on.\nNote: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive\ninformation from the debug log before sending it to the bug\naddress.  The \"-d\" won't go out of its way to collect\nsensitive information, but the log\nwill\ncontain a fairly\ncomplete transcript of Wget's communication with the server,\nwhich may include passwords and pieces of downloaded data.\nSince the bug address is publicly archived, you may assume\nthat all bug reports are visible to the public.\n4.  If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. \"gdb\n`which wget` core\" and type \"where\" to get the backtrace.\nThis may not work if the system administrator has disabled\ncore files, but it is safe to try.\nSEE ALSO\ntop\nThis is\nnot\nthe complete manual for GNU Wget.

These files can be spread\nout over several devices. The\nmount\ncommand serves to attach the\nfilesystem found on some device to the big file tree. Conversely,\nthe\numount(8)\ncommand will detach it again. The filesystem is used\nto control how data is stored on the device or provided in a\nvirtual way by network or other services.\nThe standard form of the\nmount\ncommand is:\nmount -t\ntype device dir\nThis tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on\ndevice\n(which is of type\ntype\n) at the directory\ndir\n. The option\n-t\ntype\nis optional. The\nmount\ncommand is usually able to detect a\nfilesystem. The root permissions are necessary to mount a\nfilesystem by default. See section \"Non-superuser mounts\" below\nfor more details. The previous contents (if any) and owner and\nmode of\ndir\nbecome invisible, and as long as this filesystem\nremains mounted, the pathname\ndir\nrefers to the root of the\nfilesystem on\ndevice\n.\nIf only the directory or the device is given, for example:\nmount\n/dir\nthen\nmount\nlooks for a mountpoint (and if not found then for a\ndevice) in the\n/etc/fstab\nfile. Itâs possible to use the\n--target\nor\n--source\noptions to avoid ambiguous interpretation of the given\nargument. For example:\nmount --target\n/mountpoint\nThe same filesystem may be mounted more than once, and in some\ncases (e.g., network filesystems) the same filesystem may be\nmounted on the same mountpoint multiple times. The\nmount\ncommand\ndoes not implement any policy to control this behavior. All\nbehavior is controlled by the kernel and it is usually specific to\nthe filesystem driver. The exception is\n--all\n, in this case\nalready mounted filesystems are ignored (see\n--all\nbelow for more\ndetails).\nListing the mounts\nThe listing mode is maintained for backward compatibility only.\nFor more robust and customizable output use\nfindmnt(8)\n,\nespecially\nin your scripts\n. Note that control characters in the mountpoint\nname are replaced with '?'.\nThe following command lists all mounted filesystems (of type\ntype\n):\nmount\n[\n-l\n] [\n-t\ntype\n]\nThe option\n-l\nadds labels to this listing. See below.\nIndicating the device and filesystem\nMost devices are indicated by a filename (of a block special\ndevice), like\n/dev/sda1\n, but there are other possibilities. For\nexample, in the case of an NFS mount,\ndevice\nmay look like\nknuth.cwi.nl:/dir\n.\nThe device names of disk partitions are unstable; hardware\nreconfiguration, and adding or removing a device can cause changes\nin names. This is the reason why itâs strongly recommended to use\nfilesystem or partition identifiers like UUID or LABEL. Currently\nsupported identifiers (tags):\nLABEL=\nlabel\nHuman readable filesystem identifier. See also\n-L\n.\nUUID=\nuuid\nFilesystem universally unique identifier. The format of the\nUUID is usually a series of hex digits separated by hyphens.\nSee also\n-U\n.\nNote that\nmount\nuses UUIDs as strings. The UUIDs from the\ncommand line or from\nfstab(5)\nare not converted to internal\nbinary representation. The string representation of the UUID\nshould be based on lower case characters.\nPARTLABEL=\nlabel\nHuman readable partition identifier. This identifier is\nindependent on filesystem and does not change by\nmkfs\nor\nmkswap\noperations. Itâs supported for example for GUID\nPartition Tables (GPT).\nPARTUUID=\nuuid\nPartition universally unique identifier. This identifier is\nindependent on filesystem and does not change by\nmkfs\nor\nmkswap\noperations. Itâs supported for example for GUID\nPartition Tables (GPT).\nID=\nid\nHardware block device ID as generated by udevd. This\nidentifier is usually based on WWN (unique storage identifier)\nand assigned by the hardware manufacturer. See\nls\n/dev/disk/by-id\nfor more details, this directory and running\nudevd is required. This identifier is not recommended for\ngeneric use as the identifier is not strictly defined and it\ndepends on udev, udev rules and hardware.\nThe command\nlsblk --fs\nprovides an overview of filesystems, LABELs\nand UUIDs on available block devices. The command\nblkid -p\n<device>\nprovides details about a filesystem on the specified\ndevice.\nDonât forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are\nreally unique, especially if you move, share or copy the device.\nUse\nlsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID\nto verify that the UUIDs are really\nunique in your system.\nThe recommended setup is to use tags (e.g.\nUUID\n=\nuuid\n) rather than\n/dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,id,partuuid,partlabel}\nudev symlinks in\nthe\n/etc/fstab\nfile. Tags are more readable, robust and portable.\nThe\nmount(8)\ncommand internally uses udev symlinks, so the use of\nsymlinks in\n/etc/fstab\nhas no advantage over tags. For more\ndetails see\nlibblkid(3)\n.\nThe\nproc\nfilesystem is not associated with a special device, and\nwhen mounting it, an arbitrary keyword - for example,\nproc\n- can\nbe used instead of a device specification. (The customary choice\nnone\nis less fortunate: the error message 'none already mounted'\nfrom\nmount\ncan be confusing.)\nThe files /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts\nThe file\n/etc/fstab\n(see\nfstab(5)\n), may contain lines describing\nwhat devices are usually mounted where, using which options. The\ndefault location of the\nfstab(5)\nfile can be overridden with the\n--fstab\npath\ncommand-line option (see below for more details).\nThe command\nmount -a\n[\n-t\ntype\n] [\n-O\noptlist\n]\n(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned\nin\nfstab\n(of the proper type and/or having or not having the\nproper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose\nline contains the\nnoauto\nkeyword. Adding the\n-F\noption will make\nmount\nfork, so that the filesystems are mounted in parallel.\nWhen mounting a filesystem mentioned in\nfstab\nor\nmtab\n, it suffices\nto specify on the command line only the device, or only the mount\npoint.\nThe programs\nmount\nand\numount(8)\ntraditionally maintained a list\nof currently mounted filesystems in the file\n/etc/mtab\n. The\nsupport for regular classic\n/etc/mtab\nis completely disabled at\ncompile time by default, because on current Linux systems it is\nbetter to make\n/etc/mtab\na symlink to\n/proc/mounts\ninstead. The\nregular\nmtab\nfile maintained in userspace cannot reliably work\nwith namespaces, containers and other advanced Linux features. If\nthe regular\nmtab\nsupport is enabled, then itâs possible to use the\nfile as well as the symlink.\nIf no arguments are given to\nmount\n, the list of mounted\nfilesystems is printed.\nIf you want to override mount options from\n/etc/fstab\n, you have to\nuse the\n-o\noption:\nmount\ndevice\n|\ndir\n-o\noptions\nand then the mount options from the command line will be appended\nto the list of options from\n/etc/fstab\n. This default behaviour can\nbe changed using the\n--options-mode\ncommand-line option. The usual\nbehavior is that the last option wins if there are conflicting\nones.\nThe\nmount\nprogram does not read the\n/etc/fstab\nfile if both\ndevice\n(or LABEL, UUID, ID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL) and\ndir\nare specified.\nFor example, to mount device\nfoo\nat\n/dir\n:\nmount /dev/foo /dir\nThis default behaviour can be changed by using the\n--options-source-force\ncommand-line option to always read\nconfiguration from\nfstab\n. For non-root users\nmount\nalways reads\nthe\nfstab\nconfiguration.\nNon-superuser mounts\nNormally, only the superuser can mount filesystems. However, when\nfstab\ncontains the\nuser\noption on a line, anybody can mount the\ncorresponding filesystem.\nThus, given a line\n/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide\nany user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on an inserted\nCDROM using the command:\nmount /cd\nNote that\nmount\nis very strict about non-root users and all paths\nspecified on command line are verified before\nfstab\nis parsed or a\nhelper program is executed. Itâs strongly recommended to use a\nvalid mountpoint to specify filesystem, otherwise\nmount\nmay fail.\nFor example itâs a bad idea to use NFS or CIFS source on command\nline.\nSince util-linux 2.35,\nmount\ndoes not exit when user permissions\nare inadequate according to libmountâs internal security rules.\nInstead, it drops suid permissions and continues as regular\nnon-root user. This behavior supports use-cases where root\npermissions are not necessary (e.g., fuse filesystems, user\nnamespaces, etc).\nFor more details, see\nfstab(5)\n. Only the user that mounted a\nfilesystem can unmount it again. If any user should be able to\nunmount it, then use\nusers\ninstead of\nuser\nin the\nfstab\nline. The\nowner\noption is similar to the\nuser\noption, with the restriction\nthat the user must be the owner of the special file. This may be\nuseful e.g. for\n/dev/fd\nif a login script makes the console user\nowner of this device. The\ngroup\noption is similar, with the\nrestriction that the user must be a member of the group of the\nspecial file.\nThe\nuser\nmount option is accepted if no username is specified. If\nused in the format\nuser=someone\n, the option is silently ignored\nand visible only for external mount helpers (/sbin/mount.<type>)\nfor compatibility with some network filesystems.\nBind mount operation\nRemount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is:\nmount --bind\nolddir newdir\nor by using this\nfstab\nentry:\n/\nolddir\n/\nnewdir\nnone bind\nAfter this call the same contents are accessible in two places.\nIt is important to understand that \"bind\" does not create any\nsecond-class or special node in the kernel VFS. The \"bind\" is just\nanother operation to attach a filesystem. There is nowhere stored\ninformation that the filesystem has been attached by a \"bind\"\noperation. The\nolddir\nand\nnewdir\nare independent and the\nolddir\nmay be unmounted.\nOne can also remount a single file (on a single file). Itâs also\npossible to use a bind mount to create a mountpoint from a regular\ndirectory, for example:\nmount --bind foo foo\nThe bind mount call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem,\nnot possible submounts. The entire file hierarchy including\nsubmounts can be attached a second place by using:\nmount --rbind\nolddir newdir\nNote that the filesystem mount options maintained by the kernel\nwill remain the same as those on the original mount point. The\nuserspace mount options (e.g., _netdev) will not be copied by\nmount\nand itâs necessary to explicitly specify the options on the\nmount\ncommand line.\nSince util-linux 2.27\nmount\npermits changing the mount options by\npassing the relevant options along with\n--bind\n. For example:\nmount -o bind,ro foo foo\nThis feature is not supported by the Linux kernel; it is\nimplemented in userspace by an additional\nmount(2)\nremounting\nsystem call. This solution is not atomic.\nThe alternative (classic) way to create a read-only bind mount is\nto use the remount operation, for example:\nmount --bind\nolddir newdir\nmount -o remount,bind,ro\nolddir newdir\nNote that a read-only bind will create a read-only mountpoint (VFS\nentry), but the original filesystem superblock will still be\nwritable, meaning that the\nolddir\nwill be writable, but the\nnewdir\nwill be read-only.\nItâs also possible to change nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime,\nnodiratime, relatime and nosymfollow VFS entry flags via a\n\"remount,bind\" operation. The other flags (for example\nfilesystem-specific flags) are silently ignored. The classic\nmount(2)\nsystem call does not allow to change mount options\nrecursively (for example with\n-o rbind,ro\n). The recursive semantic\nis possible with a new\nmount_setattr(2)\nkernel system call and\nitâs supported since libmount from util-linux v2.39 by a new\nexperimental \"recursive\" option argument (e.g.\n-o\nrbind,ro=recursive\n). For more details see the\nFILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS\nsection.\nSince util-linux 2.31,\nmount\nignores the\nbind\nflag from\n/etc/fstab\non a\nremount\noperation (if\n-o remount\nis specified on command\nline). This is necessary to fully control mount options on remount\nby command line. In previous versions the bind flag has been\nalways applied and it was impossible to re-define mount options\nwithout interaction with the bind semantic. This\nmount\nbehavior\ndoes not affect situations when \"remount,bind\" is specified in the\n/etc/fstab\nfile.\nSince util-linux 2.39,\nmount\nmay use the new kernel mount API if\nit is available. This new kernel interface provides a more precise\nway to work with mountpoint attributes. For example, the\n-o\nbind,rw\noperation will create a read-write node even if the\noriginal node was read-only. This was impossible with the old\nclassic mount(2) syscall, where the read-only VFS flag was\ninherited from the original node.\nThe move operation\nMove a\nmounted tree\nto another place (atomically). The call is:\nmount --move\nolddir newdir\nThis will cause the contents which previously appeared under\nolddir\nto now be accessible under\nnewdir\n. The physical location of\nthe files is not changed. Note that\nolddir\nhas to be a mountpoint.\nNote also that moving a mount residing under a shared mount is\ninvalid and unsupported. Use\nfindmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION\nto see\nthe current propagation flags.\nShared subtree operations\nSince Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its\nsubmounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount\nprovides the ability to create mirrors of that mount such that\nmounts and unmounts within any of the mirrors propagate to the\nother mirror. A slave mount receives propagation from its master,\nbut not vice versa. A private mount carries no propagation\nabilities. An unbindable mount is a private mount which cannot be\ncloned through a bind operation. The detailed semantics are\ndocumented in\nDocumentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt\nfile in\nthe kernel source tree; see also\nmount_namespaces(7)\n.\nSupported operations are:\nmount --make-shared mountpoint\nmount --make-slave mountpoint\nmount --make-private mountpoint\nmount --make-unbindable mountpoint\nThe following commands allow one to recursively change the type of\nall the mounts under a given mountpoint.\nmount --make-rshared mountpoint\nmount --make-rslave mountpoint\nmount --make-rprivate mountpoint\nmount --make-runbindable mountpoint\nmount does not read fstab\n(5) when a\n--make-\n* operation is\nrequested. All necessary information has to be specified on the\ncommand line.\nNote that the Linux kernel does not allow changing multiple\npropagation flags with a single\nmount(2)\nsystem call, and the\nflags cannot be mixed with other mount options and operations.\nSince util-linux 2.23 the\nmount\ncommand can be used to do more\npropagation (topology) changes by one\nmount(8)\ncall and do it also\ntogether with other mount operations. The propagation flags are\napplied by additional\nmount(2)\nsystem calls when the preceding\nmount operations were successful. Note that this use case is not\natomic. It is possible to specify the propagation flags in\nfstab(5)\nas mount options (\nprivate\n,\nslave\n,\nshared\n,\nunbindable\n,\nrprivate\n,\nrslave\n,\nrshared\n,\nrunbindable\n).\nFor example:\nmount --make-private --make-unbindable /dev/sda1 /foo\nis the same as:\nmount /dev/sda1 /foo\nmount --make-private /foo\nmount --make-unbindable /foo\nCOMMAND-LINE OPTIONS\ntop\nThe full set of mount options used by an invocation of\nmount\nis\ndetermined by first extracting the mount options for the\nfilesystem from the\nfstab\ntable, then applying any options\nspecified by the\n-o\nargument, and finally applying a\n-r\nor\n-w\noption, when present.\nThe\nmount\ncommand does not pass all command-line options to the\n/sbin/mount.\nsuffix\nmount helpers. The interface between\nmount\nand\nthe mount helpers is described below in the\nEXTERNAL HELPERS\nsection.\nCommand-line options available for the\nmount\ncommand are:\n-a\n,\n--all\nMount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in\nfstab\n(except for those whose line contains the\nnoauto\nkeyword). The\nfilesystems are mounted following their order in\nfstab\n. The\nmount\ncommand compares filesystem source, target (and fs root\nfor bind mount or btrfs) to detect already mounted\nfilesystems. The kernel table with already mounted filesystems\nis cached during\nmount --all\n. This means that all duplicated\nfstab\nentries will be mounted.\nThe correct functionality depends on\n/proc\n(to detect already\nmounted filesystems) and on\n/sys\n(to evaluate filesystem tags\nlike UUID= or LABEL=). Itâs strongly recommended to mount\n/proc\nand\n/sys\nfilesystems before\nmount -a\nis executed, or\nkeep /proc and /sys at the beginning of\nfstab\n.\nThe option\n--all\nis possible to use for remount operation too.\nIn this case all filters (\n-t\nand\n-O\n) are applied to the table\nof already mounted filesystems.\nSince version 2.35 it is possible to use the command line\noption\n-o\nto alter mount options from\nfstab\n(see also\n--options-mode\n).\nNote that it is a bad practice to use\nmount -a\nfor\nfstab\nchecking. The recommended solution is\nfindmnt --verify\n.\n-B\n,\n--bind\nRemount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are\navailable in both places). See above, under\nBind mount\noperation\n.\n-c\n,\n--no-canonicalize\nDo not canonicalize any paths or tags during the mount\nprocess. The\nmount\ncommand automatically canonicalizes all\npaths (from the command line or\nfstab\n). This option can be\nused in conjunction with the\n-f\nflag for paths that are\nalready canonicalized. This option is intended for mount\nhelpers that call\nmount -i\n. It is highly recommended to not\nuse this command-line option for regular mount operations. See\nalso the X-mount.nocanonicalize mount options.\nNote that\nmount\ndoes not pass this option to the\n/sbin/mount.\ntype\nhelpers.\n--exclusive\nEnsures that the filesystem is mounted as a unique instance\nand that the filesystem superblock is not reused by the\nkernel. The filesystem may be reused later if mounted without\nthe option. The option affects only the current mount and is\nallowed for non-root users as well.\nSee also the\n--onlyonce\noption. The difference between\n--onlyonce\nand\n--exclusive\nis that \"onlyonce\" ensures the same\nsource is not mounted on the same mount point; this means\nmounting twice on /A is not allowed, but mounting on /A and /B\nis allowed. The \"exclusive\" mount ensures the filesystem\nitself is not reused, regardless of the mount point.\n-F\n,\n--fork\n(Used in conjunction with\n-a\n.) Fork off a new incarnation of\nmount\nfor each device. This will do the mounts on different\ndevices or different NFS servers in parallel. This has the\nadvantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts proceed in\nparallel. A disadvantage is that the order of the mount\noperations is undefined. Thus, you cannot use this option if\nyou want to mount both\n/usr\nand\n/usr/spool\n.\n-f, --fake\nCauses everything to be done except for the mount-related\nsystem calls. The\n--fake\noption was originally designed to\nwrite an entry to\n/etc/mtab\nwithout actually mounting.\nThe\n/etc/mtab\nis no longer maintained in userspace, and\nstarting from version 2.39, the mount operation can be a\ncomplex chain of operations with dependencies between the\nsyscalls. The\n--fake\noption forces libmount to skip all mount\nsource preparation, mount option analysis, and the actual\nmounting process.\nThe difference between fake and non-fake execution is huge.\nThis is the reason why the\n--fake\noption has minimal\nsignificance for the current\nmount(8)\nimplementation and it is\nmaintained mostly for backward compatibility.\n-i, --internal-only\nDonât call the\n/sbin/mount.\nfilesystem\nhelper even if it\nexists.\n-L\n,\n--label\nlabel\nMount the partition that has the specified\nlabel\n.\n-l\n,\n--show-labels\nAdd the labels in the mount output.\nmount\nmust have permission\nto read the disk device (e.g. be set-user-ID root) for this to\nwork. One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using\nthe\ne2label(8)\nutility, or for XFS using\nxfs_admin(8)\n, or for\nreiserfs using\nreiserfstune\n(8).\n-M\n,\n--move\nMove a subtree to some other place. See above, the subsection\nThe move operation\n.\n-m\n,\n--mkdir\n[\n=\nmode\n]\nAllow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not\nexist yet. Alias to \"-o X-mount.mkdir[=mode]\", the default\nmode is 0755. For more details see\nX-mount.mkdir\nbelow.\n--map-groups\n,\n--map-users\ninner\n:_outer_:_count_\nAdd the specified user/group mapping to an\nX-mount.idmap\nmap.\nThese options can be given multiple times to build up complete\nmappings for users and groups. For more details see\nX-mount.idmap\nbelow.\n--map-users\n/proc/\nPID\n/ns/user\nUse the specified user namespace for user and group mapping in\nan id-mapped mount. This is an alias for \"-o\nX-mount.idmap=/proc/\nPID\n/ns/user\" and cannot be used twice nor\ntogether with the\ninner\n:_outer_:_count_ option format above.\nFor more details see\nX-mount.idmap\nbelow.\n-n\n,\n--no-mtab\nMount without writing in\n/etc/mtab\n. This is necessary for\nexample when\n/etc\nis on a read-only filesystem.\n-N\n,\n--namespace\nns\nPerform the mount operation in the mount namespace specified\nby\nns\n.\nns\nis either PID of process running in that namespace\nor special file representing that namespace.\nmount\nswitches to the mount namespace when it reads\n/etc/fstab\n, writes\n/etc/mtab: (or writes to _/run/mount\n) and\ncalls\nmount(2)\n, otherwise it runs in the original mount\nnamespace. This means that the target namespace does not have\nto contain any libraries or other requirements necessary to\nexecute the\nmount(2)\ncall.\nSee\nmount_namespaces(7)\nfor more information.\n-O\n,\n--test-opts\nopts\nLimit the set of filesystems to which the\n-a\noption applies.\nIn this regard it is like the\n-t\noption except that\n-O\nis\nuseless without\n-a\n. For example, the command\nmount -a -O no_netdev\nmounts all filesystems except those which have the option\nnetdev\nspecified in the options field in the\n/etc/fstab\nfile.\nIt is different from\n-t\nin that each option is matched\nexactly; a leading\nno\nat the beginning of one option does not\nnegate the rest.\nThe\n-t\nand\n-O\noptions are cumulative in effect; that is, the\ncommand\nmount -a -t ext2 -O  _netdev\nmounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all\nfilesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option\nspecified.\n-o\n,\n--options\nopts\nUse the specified mount options. The\nopts\nargument is a\ncomma-separated list. For example:\nmount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nodev,nosuid\nNote that the order of the options matters, as the last option\nwins if there are conflicting ones. Also, options on the\ncommand line override options from fstab.\nFor more details, see the\nFILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS\nand\nFILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS\nsections.\n--onlyonce\nForces\nmount\ncommand to check if the filesystem is already\nmounted on specified mountpoint. This behavior is the default\nfor\n--all\n; otherwise, it depends on the kernel filesystem\ndriver. Some filesystems may be mounted more than once on the\nsame mount point (e.g. tmpfs). See also\n--exclusive\n.\n--options-mode\nmode\nControls how to combine options from\nfstab\n/\nmtab\nwith options\nfrom the command line.\nmode\ncan be one of\nignore\n,\nappend\n,\nprepend\nor\nreplace\n. For example,\nappend\nmeans that options\nfrom\nfstab\nare appended to options from the command line. The\ndefault value is\nprepend\nâ it means command line options are\nevaluated after\nfstab\noptions. Note that the last option wins\nif there are conflicting ones.\n--options-source\nsource\nSource of default options.\nsource\nis a comma-separated list of\nfstab\n,\nmtab\nand\ndisable\n.\ndisable\ndisables\nfstab\nand\nmtab\nand\nenables\n--options-source-force\n.

See\nabove, the subsection\nBind mount operation\n.\n-r\n,\n--read-only\nMount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is\n-o ro\n.\nNote that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel\nbehavior, the system may still write to the device. For\nexample, ext3 and ext4 will replay the journal if the\nfilesystem is dirty. To prevent this kind of write access, you\nmay want to mount an ext3 or ext4 filesystem with the\nro,noload\nmount options or set the block device itself to\nread-only mode, see the\nblockdev(8)\ncommand.\n-s\nTolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will\nignore mount options not supported by a filesystem type. Not\nall filesystems support this option. Currently itâs supported\nby the\nmount.nfs\nmount helper only.\n--source\ndevice\nIf only one argument for the\nmount\ncommand is given, then the\nargument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or\nsource (device). This option allows you to explicitly define\nthat the argument is the mount source.\n--target\ndirectory\nIf only one argument for the mount command is given, then the\nargument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or\nsource (device). This option allows you to explicitly define\nthat the argument is the mount target.\n--target-prefix\ndirectory\nPrepend the specified directory to all mount targets. This\noption can be used to follow\nfstab\n, but mount operations are\ndone in another place, for example:\nmount --all --target-prefix /chroot -o X-mount.mkdir\nmounts all from system\nfstab\nto\n/chroot\n, all missing\nmountpoint are created (due to X-mount.mkdir). See also\n--fstab\nto use an alternative\nfstab\n.\n-T\n,\n--fstab\npath\nSpecifies an alternative\nfstab\nfile. If\npath\nis a directory,\nthen the files in the directory are sorted by\nstrverscmp(3)\n;\nfiles that start with \".\" or without an\n.fstab\nextension are\nignored. The option can be specified more than once. This\noption is mostly designed for initramfs or chroot scripts\nwhere additional configuration is specified beyond standard\nsystem configuration.\nNote that\nmount\ndoes not pass the option\n--fstab\nto the\n/sbin/mount.\ntype\nhelpers, meaning that the alternative\nfstab\nfiles will be invisible for the helpers. This is no problem\nfor normal mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always require\nfstab\nto verify the userâs rights.\n-t\n,\n--types\nfstype\nThe argument following the\n-t\nis used to indicate the\nfilesystem type. The filesystem types which are currently\nsupported depend on the running kernel. See\n/proc/filesystems\nand\n/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs\nfor a complete list of\nthe filesystems. The most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs,\nbtrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.\nThe programs\nmount\nand\numount(8)\nsupport filesystem subtypes.\nThe subtype is defined by a '.subtype' suffix. For example\n'fuse.sshfs'. Itâs recommended to use subtype notation rather\nthan add any prefix to the mount source (for example\n'sshfs#example.com' is deprecated).\nIf no\n-t\noption is given, or if the\nauto\ntype is specified,\nmount\nwill try to guess the desired type.\nmount\nuses the\nlibblkid(3)\nlibrary for guessing the filesystem type; if that\ndoes not turn up anything that looks familiar,\nmount\nwill try\nto read the file\n/etc/filesystems\n, or, if that does not exist,\n/proc/filesystems\n. All of the filesystem types listed there\nwill be tried, except for those that are labeled \"nodev\" (e.g.\ndevpts\n,\nproc\nand\nnfs\n). If\n/etc/filesystems\nends in a line with\na single *, mount will read\n/proc/filesystems\nafterwards.\nWhile trying, all filesystem types will be mounted with the\nmount option\nsilent\n.\nThe\nauto\ntype may be useful for user-mounted floppies.\nCreating a file\n/etc/filesystems\ncan be useful to change the\nprobe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before\next2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.\nMore than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list,\nfor the\n-t\noption as well as in an\n/etc/fstab\nentry. The list\nof filesystem types for the\n-t\noption can be prefixed with\nno\nto specify the filesystem types on which no action should be\ntaken. The prefix\nno\nhas no effect when specified in an\n/etc/fstab\nentry.\nThe prefix\nno\ncan be meaningful with the\n-a\noption. For\nexample, the command\nmount -a -t nomsdos,smbfs\nmounts all filesystems except those of type\nmsdos\nand\nsmbfs\n.\nFor most types all the\nmount\nprogram has to do is issue a\nsimple\nmount(2)\nsystem call, and no detailed knowledge of the\nfilesystem type is required. For a few types however (like\nnfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary.\nThe nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a\nseparate mount program. In order to make it possible to treat\nall types in a uniform way,\nmount\nwill execute the program\n/sbin/mount.\ntype\n(if that exists) when called with type\ntype\n.\nSince different versions of the\nsmbmount\nprogram have\ndifferent calling conventions,\n/sbin/mount.smbfs\nmay have to\nbe a shell script that sets up the desired call.\n-U\n,\n--uuid\nuuid\nMount the partition that has the specified\nuuid\n.\n-v\n,\n--verbose\nEnables verbose mode. Starting from version 2.41, if the new\nkernel mount API is available, it will also print kernel info\nmessages.\n-w\n,\n--rw\n,\n--read-write\nMount the filesystem read/write. Read-write is the kernel\ndefault and the\nmount\ndefault is to try read-only if the\nprevious\nmount(2)\nsyscall with read-write flags on\nwrite-protected devices failed.\nA synonym is\n-o rw\n.\nNote that specifying\n-w\non the command line forces\nmount\nto\nnever try read-only mount on write-protected devices or\nalready mounted read-only filesystems.\n-h\n,\n--help\nDisplay help text and exit.\n-V\n,\n--version\nDisplay version and exit.\nFILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS\ntop\nSome of these options are only useful when they appear in the\n/etc/fstab\nfile.\nSome of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in\nthe system kernel. To check the current setting see the options in\n/proc/mounts\n. Note that filesystems also have per-filesystem\nspecific default mount options (see for example\ntune2fs -l\noutput\nfor ext\nN\nfilesystems).\nVirtual Filesystem Notes\nThe Virtual File System (VFS) is the abstract layer in the kernel\nthat provides the filesystem interface to userspace programs. It\nalso provides an abstraction within the kernel which allows\ndifferent filesystem implementations to coexist. Some of the mount\noptions only apply to this layer.\nThe options\nnosuid\n,\nnoexec\n,\nnodiratime\n,\nrelatime\n,\nnoatime\n,\nstrictatime\n, and\nnosymfollow\nare interpreted only by the\nvirtual-filesystem kernel layer and are applied to the mountpoint\nnode rather than to the filesystem itself. To get a complete\noverview of filesystems and VFS options, try:\nfindmnt -o TARGET,VFS-OPTIONS,FS-OPTIONS\nSince v2.39, libmount can use a new kernel mount interface to set\nthe VFS attributes recursively. For backward compatibility, this\nfeature is not enabled by default, even if recursive operation\n(e.g. rbind) has been requested. The new option argument\n\"recursive\" can be specified, for example:\nmount -orbind,ro=recursive,noexec=recursive,nosuid /foo /bar\nThis recursively binds filesystems from /foo to /bar, making /bar\nand all submounts read-only and noexec, but only /bar itself will\nbe \"nosuid\". The \"recursive\" optional argument for VFS mount\noptions is an EXPERIMENTAL feature.\nRead-only Setting Notes\nThe read-only setting (\nro\nor\nrw\n) is interpreted by the\nvirtual-filesystem and the filesystem, and it depends on how the\noption is specified on the\nmount(8)\ncommand line. For backward\ncompatibility, the default is to use it for both layers during\nstandard mount operations.\nThe operation \"-o bind,remount,ro\" is applied only to the VFS\nmountpoint, while the operation \"-o remount,ro\" is applied to both\nthe VFS and filesystem superblock. This semantic allows for the\ncreation of a read-only mountpoint while keeping the filesystem\nwritable from another mountpoint.\nSince version 2.41, libmount has the ability to use optional\narguments\nvfs\nand\nfs\n(e.g. ro=fs) to specify where the read-only\nsetting should be applied. For example, using the command:\nmount -o ro=vfs /dev/sdc1 /A\nwill mount the filesystem as read-write on the superblock level,\nbut the /A node will be set as read-only. In previous versions,\nthis required an additional \"-o bind,remount,ro\" operation to\nachieve the same result.\nGeneric Mount Options\nThe following options apply to any filesystem that is being\nmounted, but not every filesystem actually honors them. For\nexample, the\nsync\noption only has an effect on ext2, ext3, ext4,\nfat, vfat, ufs, and xfs filesystems.\nasync\nAll I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously. (See\nalso the\nsync\noption.)\natime\nDo not use the\nnoatime\nfeature, so the inode access time is\ncontrolled by kernel defaults. See also the descriptions of\nthe\nrelatime\nand\nstrictatime\nmount options.\nnoatime\nDo not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g. for\nfaster access on the news spool to speed up news servers).\nThis works for all inode types (directories too), so it\nimplies\nnodiratime\n.\nauto\nCan be mounted with the\n-a\noption.\nnoauto\nCan only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the\n-a\noption will not\ncause the filesystem to be mounted).\ncontext=\ncontext\n,\nfscontext=\ncontext\n,\ndefcontext=\ncontext\n, and\nrootcontext=\ncontext\nThe\ncontext=\noption is useful when mounting filesystems that\ndo not support extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard\ndisk formatted with VFAT, or systems that are not normally\nrunning under SELinux, such as an ext3 or ext4 formatted disk\nfrom a non-SELinux workstation. You can also use\ncontext=\non\nfilesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps\nin compatibility with xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier\n2.4.<x> kernel versions. Even where xattrs are supported, you\ncan save time not having to label every file by assigning the\nentire disk one security context.\nA commonly used option for removable media is\ncontext=\"system_u:object_r:removable_t\n.\nThe\nfscontext=\noption works for all filesystems, regardless of\ntheir xattr support. The fscontext option sets the overarching\nfilesystem label to a specific security context. This\nfilesystem label is separate from the individual labels on the\nfiles. It represents the entire filesystem for certain kinds\nof permission checks, such as during mount or file creation.\nIndividual file labels are still obtained from the xattrs on\nthe files themselves. The context option actually sets the\naggregate context that fscontext provides, in addition to\nsupplying the same label for individual files.\nYou can set the default security context for unlabeled files\nusing\ndefcontext=\noption. This overrides the value set for\nunlabeled files in the policy and requires a filesystem that\nsupports xattr labeling.\nThe\nrootcontext=\noption allows you to explicitly label the\nroot inode of a FS being mounted before that FS or inode\nbecomes visible to userspace. This was found to be useful for\nthings like stateless Linux. The special value\n@target\ncan be\nused to assign the current context of the target mountpoint\nlocation.\nNote that the kernel rejects any remount request that includes\nthe context option,\neven\nwhen unchanged from the current\ncontext.\nWarning: the\ncontext\nvalue might contain commas\n, in which case\nthe value has to be properly quoted, otherwise\nmount\nwill\ninterpret the comma as a separator between mount options.\nDonât forget that the shell strips off quotes and thus\ndouble\nquoting is required\n. For example:\nmount -t tmpfs none /mnt -o \\\n'context=\"system_u:object_r:tmp_t:s0:c127,c456\",noexec'\nFor more details, see\nselinux(8)\n.\ndefaults\nUse the default options:\nrw\n,\nsuid\n,\ndev\n,\nexec\n,\nauto\n,\nnouser\n,\nand\nasync\n.\nNote that the real set of all default mount options depends on\nthe kernel and filesystem type. See the beginning of this\nsection for more details.\ndev\nInterpret character or block special devices on the\nfilesystem.\nnodev\nDo not interpret character or block special devices on the\nfilesystem.\ndiratime\nUpdate directory inode access times on this filesystem. This\nis the default. (This option is ignored when\nnoatime\nis set.)\nnodiratime\nDo not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.\n(This option is implied when\nnoatime\nis set.)\ndirsync\nAll directory updates within the filesystem should be done\nsynchronously. This affects the following system calls:\ncreat(2)\n,\nlink(2)\n,\nunlink(2)\n,\nsymlink(2)\n,\nmkdir(2)\n,\nrmdir(2)\n,\nmknod(2)\nand\nrename(2)\n.\nexec\nPermit execution of binaries and other executable files.\nnoexec\nDo not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted\nfilesystem.\ngroup\nAllow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if one of that\nuserâs groups matches the group of the device. This option\nimplies the options\nnosuid\nand\nnodev\n(unless overridden by\nsubsequent options, as in the option line\ngroup,dev,suid\n).\niversion\nEvery time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be\nincremented.\nnoiversion\nDo not increment the i_version inode field.\nmand\nAllow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See\nfcntl(2)\n. This\noption was deprecated in Linux 5.15.\nnomand\nDo not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.\n_netdev\nThe filesystem resides on a device that requires network\naccess (used to prevent the system from attempting to mount\nthese filesystems until the network has been enabled on the\nsystem).\nnofail\nDo not report errors for this device if it does not exist.\nrelatime\nUpdate inode access times relative to modify or change time.\nAccess time is only updated if the previous access time was\nearlier than or equal to the current modify or change time.\n(Similar to\nnoatime\n, but it doesnât break\nmutt\n(1) or other\napplications that need to know if a file has been read since\nthe last time it was modified.)\nSince Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior\nprovided by this option (unless\nnoatime\nwas specified), and\nthe\nstrictatime\noption is required to obtain traditional\nsemantics. In addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the fileâs last\naccess time is always updated if it is more than 1 day old.\nnorelatime\nDo not use the\nrelatime\nfeature. See also the\nstrictatime\nmount option.\nstrictatime\nAllows to explicitly request full atime updates. This makes it\npossible for the kernel to default to\nrelatime\nor\nnoatime\nbut\nstill allow userspace to override it. For more details about\nthe default system mount options see\n/proc/mounts\n.\nnostrictatime\nUse the kernelâs default behavior for inode access time\nupdates.\nlazytime\nOnly update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory\nversion of the file inode.\nThis mount option significantly reduces writes to the inode\ntable for workloads that perform frequent random writes to\npreallocated files.\nThe on-disk timestamps are updated only when:\nâ¢   the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated to\nfile timestamps\nâ¢   the application employs\nfsync(2)\n,\nsyncfs(2)\n, or\nsync(2)\nâ¢   an undeleted inode is evicted from memory\nâ¢   more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was written\nto disk.\nnolazytime\nDo not use the lazytime feature.\nsuid\nHonor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities\nwhen executing programs from this filesystem.\nnosuid\nDo not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file\ncapabilities when executing programs from this filesystem. In\naddition, SELinux domain transitions require permission\nnosuid_transition\n, which in turn needs also policy capability\nnnp_nosuid_transition\n.\nsilent\nTurn on the silent flag.\nloud\nTurn off the silent flag.\nowner\nAllow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem if that user is\nthe owner of the device. This option implies the options\nnosuid\nand\nnodev\n(unless overridden by subsequent options, as\nin the option line\nowner,dev,suid\n).\nremount\nAttempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem. This is\ncommonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem,\nespecially to make a readonly filesystem writable. It does not\nchange device or mount point.\nThe remount operation together with the\nbind\nflag has special\nsemantics. See above, the subsection\nBind mount operation\n.\nThe default kernel behavior for VFS mount flags\n(nodev,nosuid,noexec,ro) is to reset all unspecified flags on\nremount. Thatâs why\nmount(8)\ntries to keep the current setting\naccording to\nfstab\nor\n/proc/self/mountinfo\n. This default\nbehavior is possible to change by\n--options-mode\n. The\nrecursive change of the mount flags (supported since v2.39 on\nsystems with\nmount_setattr(2)\nsyscall), for example,\nmount -o\nremount,ro=recursive\n, do not use \"reset-unspecified\" behavior,\nand it works as a simple add/remove operation and unspecified\nflags are not modified.\nThe remount functionality follows the standard way the\nmount\ncommand works with options from\nfstab\n. This means that\nmount\ndoes not read\nfstab\n(or\nmtab\n) only when both\ndevice\nand\ndir\nare specified.\nmount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir\nAfter this call all old mount options are replaced and\narbitrary stuff from\nfstab\n(or\nmtab\n) is ignored, except the\nloop=\noption which is internally generated and maintained by\nthe\nmount\ncommand.\nmount -o remount,rw /dir\nAfter this call,\nmount\nreads\nfstab\nand merges these options\nwith the options from the command line (\n-o\n). If no mountpoint\nis found in\nfstab\n, then it defaults to mount options from\n/proc/self/mountinfo\n.\nmount\nallows the use of\n--all\nto remount all already mounted\nfilesystems which match a specified filter (\n-O\nand\n-t\n). For\nexample:\nmount --all -o remount,ro -t vfat\nremounts all already mounted vfat filesystems in read-only\nmode. Each of the filesystems is remounted by\nmount -o\nremount,ro\n/dir\nsemantic. This means the\nmount\ncommand reads\nfstab\nor\nmtab\nand merges these options with the options from\nthe command line.\nro\n[\n=\n(\nrecursive\n|\nvfs\n|\nfs\n)]\nMount the filesystem read-only. The optional argument is an\nexperimental feature supported only by the file-descriptor\nbased kernel mount API and it is silently ignored for the old\nmount(2)\nsyscall.\nThe\nrecursive\nargument forces the VFS attribute to be applied\nrecursively.\nThe\nvfs\nand\nfs\narguments specify the layer where the read-only\nflag should be applied. The\nfs\nspecifies the filesystem\nsuperblock (unique filesystem instance in the kernel), and\nvfs\nspecifies the mount node. If no attribute is specified, then\nboth layers are set to read-only.\nFor more details, please refer to the\nRead-only Setting Notes\nsection.\nrw\n[\n=\n(\nrecursive\n|\nvfs\n|\nfs\n)]\nMount the filesystem read-write.\nsync\nAll I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously. In the\ncase of media with a limited number of write cycles (e.g. some\nflash drives),\nsync\nmay cause life-cycle shortening.\nuser\nAllow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. The name of\nthe mounting user is written to the\nmtab\nfile (or to the\nprivate libmount file in\n/run/mount\non systems without a\nregular\nmtab\n) so that this same user can unmount the\nfilesystem again. This option implies the options\nnoexec\n,\nnosuid\n, and\nnodev\n(unless overridden by subsequent options, as\nin the option line\nuser,exec,dev,suid\n).\nnouser\nForbid an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. This is the\ndefault; it does not imply any other options.\nusers\nAllow any user to mount and to unmount the filesystem, even\nwhen some other ordinary user mounted it. This option implies\nthe options\nnoexec\n,\nnosuid\n, and\nnodev\n(unless overridden by\nsubsequent options, as in the option line\nusers,exec,dev,suid\n).\nX-\n*\nAll options prefixed with \"X-\" are interpreted as comments or\nas userspace application-specific options. These options are\nnot stored in user space (e.g.,\nmtab\nfile), nor sent to the\nmount.\ntype\nhelpers nor to the\nmount(2)\nsystem call. The\nsuggested format is\nX-\nappname\n.\noption\n.\nx-\n*\nThe same as\nX-\n* options, but stored permanently in user space.\nThis means the options are also available for\numount(8)\nor\nother operations. Note that maintaining mount options in user\nspace is tricky, because itâs necessary to use libmount-based\ntools and there is no guarantee that the options will be\nalways available (for example after a move mount operation or\nin unshared namespace).\nNote that before util-linux v2.30 the x-* options have not\nbeen maintained by libmount and stored in user space\n(functionality was the same as for X-* now), but due to the\ngrowing number of use-cases (in initrd, systemd etc.) the\nfunctionality has been extended to keep existing\nfstab\nconfigurations usable without a change.\nX-mount.auto-fstypes\n=\nlist\nSpecifies allowed or forbidden filesystem types for automatic\nfilesystem detection.\nThe\nlist\nis a comma-separated list of the filesystem names.\nThe automatic filesystem detection is triggered by the \"auto\"\nfilesystem type or when the filesystem type is not specified.\nThe\nlist\nfollows how mount evaluates type patterns (see\n-t\nfor\nmore details). Only specified filesystem types are allowed, or\nall specified types are forbidden if the list is prefixed by\n\"no\".\nFor example, X-mount.auto-fstypes=\"ext4,btrfs\" accepts only\next4 and btrfs, and X-mount.auto-fstypes=\"novfat,xfs\" accepts\nall filesystems except vfat and xfs.\nNote that comma is used as a separator between mount options,\nit means that auto-fstypes values have to be properly quoted,\ndonât forget that the shell strips off quotes and thus double\nquoting is required. For example:\nmount -t auto -oâX-mount.auto-fstypes=\"noext2,ext3\"'\n/dev/sdc1 /mnt/test\nX-mount.mkdir\n[\n=\nmode\n]\nAllow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not\nexist yet. The optional argument\nmode\nspecifies the filesystem\naccess mode used for\nmkdir(2)\nin octal notation. The default\nmode is 0755. This functionality is supported only for root\nusers or when\nmount\nis executed without suid permissions. The\noption is also supported as\nx-mount.mkdir\n, but this notation\nis deprecated since v2.30. See also\n--mkdir\ncommand line\noption.\nX-mount.nocanonicalize\n[\n=\ntype\n]\nAllows disabling of canonicalization for mount source and\ntarget paths. By default, the mount command resolves all paths\nto their absolute paths without symlinks. However, this\nbehavior may not be desired in certain situations, such as\nwhen binding a mount over a symlink, or a symlink over a\ndirectory or another symlink. The optional argument\ntype\ncan\nbe either \"source\" or \"target\" (mountpoint). If no\ntype\nis\nspecified, then canonicalization is disabled for both types.\nThis mount option does not affect the conversion of source\ntags (e.g. LABEL= or UUID=) and fstab processing.\nThe command-line option\n--no-canonicalize\noverrides this mount\noption and affects all path and tag conversions in all\nsituations, but for backward compatibility, it does not modify\nopen_tree syscall flags and does not allow the bind-mount over\na symlink use case.\nNote that\nmount(8)\nstill sanitizes and canonicalizes the\nsource and target paths specified on the command line by\nnon-root users, regardless of the X-mount.nocanonicalize\nsetting.\nX-mount.noloop\nDo not create and mount a loop device, even if the source of\nthe mount is a regular file.\nX-mount.subdir=\ndirectory\nAllow mounting a subdirectory of a filesystem instead of the\nroot directory. This is effective only when a new instance of\na filesystem is attached to the system. The option is silently\nignored for operations like remount, bind mount, or move.\nFor now, this feature is implemented by a temporary filesystem\nroot-directory mount in an unshared namespace and then binding\nthe sub-directory to the final mount point and unmounting the\nroot of the filesystem. The sub-directory mount shows up\natomically for the rest of the system although it is\nimplemented by multiple\nmount(2)\nsyscalls.\nNote that this feature will not work in session with an\nunshared private mount namespace (after\nunshare --mount\n) on\nold kernels or with\nmount(8)\nwithout support for\nfile-descriptors-based mount kernel API. In this case, you\nneed\nunshare --mount --propagation shared\n.\nThis feature is EXPERIMENTAL.\nX-mount.owner\n=\nusername\n|\nUID\n,\nX-mount.group\n=\ngroup\n|\nGID\nSet\nmountpoint\n's ownership after mounting. Names resolved in\nthe target mount namespace, see\n-N\n.\nX-mount.mode\n=\nmode\nSet\nmountpoint\n's mode after mounting.\nX-mount.idmap\n=\nid-type\n:\nid-mount\n:\nid-host\n:\nid-range\n[\nid-type\n:\nid-mount\n:\nid-host\n:\nid-range\n],\nX-mount.idmap\n=\nfile\nUse this option to create an idmapped mount. An idmapped mount\nallows to change ownership of all files located under a mount\naccording to the ID-mapping associated with a user namespace.\nThe ownership change is tied to the lifetime and localized to\nthe relevant mount. The relevant ID-mapping can be specified\nin two ways:\nâ¢   A user can specify the ID-mapping directly.\nThe ID-mapping must be specified using the syntax\nid-type\n:\nid-mount\n:\nid-host\n:\nid-range\n. Specifying\nu\nas the\nid-type\nprefix creates a UID-mapping,\ng\ncreates a\nGID-mapping and omitting\nid-type\nor specifying\nb\ncreates\nboth a UID- and GID-mapping. The\nid-mount\nparameter\nindicates the starting ID in the new mount. The\nid-host\nparameter indicates the starting ID in the filesystem. The\nid-range\nparameter indicates how many IDs are to be\nmapped. It is possible to specify multiple ID-mappings.\nThe individual ID mappings must be separated by spaces.\nPlease note that in the\n/etc/fstab\nfile, spaces are\ninterpreted as separators between fields. To avoid this,\nyou must escape them using \\040. For example,\nX-mount.idmap=0:0:1\\040500:1000:1.\nFor example, the ID-mapping\nX-mount.idmap=u:1000:0:1\ng:1001:1:2 5000:1000:2\ncreates an idmapped mount where UID\n0 is mapped to UID 1000, GID 1 is mapped to GUID 1001, GID\n2 is mapped to GID 1002, UID and GID 1000 are mapped to\n5000, and UID and GID 1001 are mapped to 5001 in the\nmount.\nWhen an ID-mapping is specified directly a new user\nnamespace will be allocated with the requested ID-mapping.\nThe newly created user namespace will be attached to the\nmount.\nâ¢   A user can specify a user namespace file.\nThe user namespace will then be attached to the mount and\nthe ID-mapping of the user namespace will become the\nID-mapping of the mount.\nFor example,\nX-mount.idmap=/proc/PID/ns/user\nwill attach\nthe user namespace of the process PID to the mount.\nnosymfollow\nDo not follow symlinks when resolving paths. Symlinks can\nstill be created, and\nreadlink(1)\n,\nreadlink(2)\n,\nrealpath(1)\n,\nand\nrealpath(3)\nall still work properly.\nFILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS\ntop\nThis section lists options that are specific to particular\nfilesystems.

We sort\nthem by filesystem. All options follow the\n-o\nflag.\nWhat options are supported depends a bit on the running kernel.\nFurther information may be available in filesystem-specific files\nin the kernel source subdirectory\nDocumentation/filesystems\n.\nMount options for adfs\nuid=\nvalue\nand\ngid=\nvalue\nSet the owner and group of the files in the filesystem\n(default: uid=gid=0).\nownmask=\nvalue\nand\nothmask=\nvalue\nSet the permission mask for ADFS 'owner' permissions and\n'other' permissions, respectively (default: 0700 and 0077,\nrespectively). See also\n/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/adfs.rst\n.\nMount options for affs\nuid=\nvalue\nand\ngid=\nvalue\nSet the owner and group of the root of the filesystem\n(default: uid=gid=0, but with option\nuid\nor\ngid\nwithout\nspecified value, the UID and GID of the current process are\ntaken).\nsetuid=\nvalue\nand\nsetgid=\nvalue\nSet the owner and group of all files.\nmode=\nvalue\nSet the mode of all files to\nvalue\n& 0777 disregarding the\noriginal permissions. Add search permission to directories\nthat have read permission. The value is given in octal.\nprotect\nDo not allow any changes to the protection bits on the\nfilesystem.\nusemp\nSet UID and GID of the root of the filesystem to the UID and\nGID of the mount point upon the first sync or umount, and then\nclear this option. Strange...\nverbose\nPrint an informational message for each successful mount.\nprefix=\nstring\nPrefix used before volume name, when following a link.\nvolume=\nstring\nPrefix (of length at most 30) used before '/' when following a\nsymbolic link.\nreserved=\nvalue\n(Default: 2.) Number of unused blocks at the start of the\ndevice.\nroot=\nvalue\nGive explicitly the location of the root block.\nbs=\nvalue\nGive blocksize. Allowed values are 512, 1024, 2048, 4096.\ngrpquota\n|\nnoquota\n|\nquota\n|\nusrquota\nThese options are accepted but ignored. (However, quota\nutilities may react to such strings in\n/etc/fstab\n.)\nMount options for debugfs\nThe debugfs filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally\nmounted on\n/sys/kernel/debug\n. As of kernel version 3.4, debugfs\nhas the following options:\nuid=\nn\n, gid=\nn\nSet the owner and group of the mountpoint.\nmode=\nvalue\nSets the mode of the mountpoint.\nMount options for devpts\nThe devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally\nmounted on\n/dev/pts\n. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a\nprocess opens\n/dev/ptmx\n; the number of the pseudo terminal is then\nmade available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be\naccessed as\n/dev/pts/\n<number>.\nuid=\nvalue\nand\ngid=\nvalue\nThis sets the owner or the group of newly created pseudo\nterminals to the specified values. When nothing is specified,\nthey will be set to the UID and GID of the creating process.\nFor example, if there is a tty group with GID 5, then\ngid=5\nwill cause newly created pseudo terminals to belong to the tty\ngroup.\nmode=\nvalue\nSet the mode of newly created pseudo terminals to the\nspecified value. The default is 0600. A value of\nmode=620\nand\ngid=5\nmakes \"mesg y\" the default on newly created pseudo\nterminals.\nnewinstance\nCreate a private instance of the devpts filesystem, such that\nindices of pseudo terminals allocated in this new instance are\nindependent of indices created in other instances of devpts.\nAll mounts of devpts without this\nnewinstance\noption share the\nsame set of pseudo terminal indices (i.e., legacy mode). Each\nmount of devpts with the\nnewinstance\noption has a private set\nof pseudo terminal indices.\nThis option is mainly used to support containers in the Linux\nkernel. It is implemented in Linux kernel versions starting\nwith 2.6.29. Further, this mount option is valid only if\nCONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES\nis enabled in the kernel\nconfiguration.\nTo use this option effectively,\n/dev/ptmx\nmust be a symbolic\nlink to\npts/ptmx\n. See\nDocumentation/filesystems/devpts.txt\nin\nthe Linux kernel source tree for details.\nptmxmode=\nvalue\nSet the mode for the new\nptmx\ndevice node in the devpts\nfilesystem.\nWith the support for multiple instances of devpts (see\nnewinstance\noption above), each instance has a private\nptmx\nnode in the root of the devpts filesystem (typically\n/dev/pts/ptmx\n).\nFor compatibility with older versions of the kernel, the\ndefault mode of the new\nptmx\nnode is 0000.\nptmxmode=\nvalue\nspecifies a more useful mode for the\nptmx\nnode and is highly\nrecommended when the\nnewinstance\noption is specified.\nThis option is only implemented in Linux kernel versions\nstarting with 2.6.29. Further, this option is valid only if\nCONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES\nis enabled in the kernel\nconfiguration.\nMount options for fat\n(Note:\nfat\nis not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the\nmsdos\n,\numsdos\nand\nvfat\nfilesystems.)\nblocksize=\n{\n512\n|\n1024\n|\n2048\n}\nSet blocksize (default 512). This option is obsolete.\nuid=\nvalue\nand\ngid=\nvalue\nSet the owner and group of all files. (Default: the UID and\nGID of the current process.)\numask=\nvalue\nSet the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are\nnot\npresent). The default is the umask of the current process. The\nvalue is given in octal.\ndmask=\nvalue\nSet the umask applied to directories only. The default is the\numask of the current process. The value is given in octal.\nfmask=\nvalue\nSet the umask applied to regular files only. The default is\nthe umask of the current process. The value is given in octal.\nallow_utime=\nvalue\nThis option controls the permission check of mtime/atime.\nPossible values:\n20\nIf the current process is in the group of the fileâs group\nID, you can change the timestamp.\n2\nOther users can change the timestamp.\nThe default is set from the above\ndmask\noption. (If the\ndirectory is writable,\nutime(2)\nis also allowed. That is:\n~dmask & 022.)\nNormally\nutime(2)\nchecks that the current process is the owner\nof the file, or that it has the\nCAP_FOWNER\ncapability. But FAT\nfilesystems donât have UID/GID on disk, so the normal check is\ntoo inflexible. With this option you can relax it.\ncheck=\nvalue\nThree different levels of pickiness can be chosen:\nr\n[\nelaxed\n]\nUpper and lower case are accepted and equivalent, long\nname parts are truncated (e.g.\nverylongname.foobar\nbecomes\nverylong.foo\n), leading and embedded spaces are accepted in\neach name part (name and extension).\nn\n[\normal\n]\nLike \"relaxed\", but many special characters (*, ?, <,\nspaces, etc.) are rejected. This is the default.\ns\n[\ntrict\n]\nLike \"normal\", but names that contain long parts or\nspecial characters that are sometimes used on Linux but\nare not accepted by MS-DOS (+, =, etc.) are rejected.\ncodepage=\nvalue\nSets the codepage for converting to shortname characters on\nFAT and VFAT filesystems. By default, codepage 437 is used.\nconv=\nmode\nThis option is obsolete and may fail or be ignored.\ncvf_format=\nmodule\nForces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume File)\nmodule cvf\n_module\ninstead of auto-detection. If the kernel\nsupports\nkmod\n, the\ncvf_format=\nxxx\noption also controls\non-demand CVF module loading. This option is obsolete.\ncvf_option=\noption\nOption passed to the CVF module. This option is obsolete.\ndebug\nTurn on the\ndebug\nflag. A version string and a list of\nfilesystem parameters will be printed (these data are also\nprinted if the parameters appear to be inconsistent).\ndiscard\nIf set, causes discard/TRIM commands to be issued to the block\ndevice when blocks are freed. This is useful for SSD devices\nand sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.\ndos1xfloppy\nIf set, use a fallback default BIOS Parameter Block\nconfiguration, determined by backing device size. These static\nparameters match defaults assumed by DOS 1.x for 160 kiB, 180\nkiB, 320 kiB, and 360 kiB floppies and floppy images.\nerrors=\n{\npanic\n|\ncontinue\n|\nremount-ro\n}\nSpecify FAT behavior on critical errors: panic, continue\nwithout doing anything, or remount the partition in read-only\nmode (default behavior).\nfat=\n{\n12\n|\n16\n|\n32\n}\nSpecify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat. This overrides the automatic\nFAT type detection routine. Use with caution!\niocharset=\nvalue\nCharacter set to use for converting between 8 bit characters\nand 16 bit Unicode characters. The default is iso8859-1. Long\nfilenames are stored on disk in Unicode format.\nnfs=\n{\nstale_rw\n|\nnostale_ro\n}\nEnable this only if you want to export the FAT filesystem over\nNFS.\nstale_rw\n: This option maintains an index (cache) of directory\ninodes which is used by the nfs-related code to improve\nlook-ups. Full file operations (read/write) over NFS are\nsupported but with cache eviction at NFS server, this could\nresult in spurious\nESTALE\nerrors.\nnostale_ro\n: This option bases the inode number and file handle\non the on-disk location of a file in the FAT directory entry.\nThis ensures that\nESTALE\nwill not be returned after a file is\nevicted from the inode cache. However, it means that\noperations such as rename, create and unlink could cause file\nhandles that previously pointed at one file to point at a\ndifferent file, potentially causing data corruption. For this\nreason, this option also mounts the filesystem readonly.\nTo maintain backward compatibility,\n-o nfs\nis also accepted,\ndefaulting to\nstale_rw\n.\ntz=UTC\nThis option disables the conversion of timestamps between\nlocal time (as used by Windows on FAT) and UTC (which Linux\nuses internally). This is particularly useful when mounting\ndevices (like digital cameras) that are set to UTC in order to\navoid the pitfalls of local time.\ntime_offset=\nminutes\nSet offset for conversion of timestamps from local time used\nby FAT to UTC. I.e.,\nminutes\nwill be subtracted from each\ntimestamp to convert it to UTC used internally by Linux. This\nis useful when the time zone set in the kernel via\nsettimeofday(2)\nis not the time zone used by the filesystem.\nNote that this option still does not provide correct time\nstamps in all cases in presence of DST - time stamps in a\ndifferent DST setting will be off by one hour.\nquiet\nTurn on the\nquiet\nflag. Attempts to chown or chmod files do\nnot return errors, although they fail. Use with caution!\nrodir\nFAT has the\nATTR_RO\n(read-only) attribute. On Windows, the\nATTR_RO\nof the directory will just be ignored, and is used\nonly by applications as a flag (e.g. itâs set for the\ncustomized folder).\nIf you want to use\nATTR_RO\nas read-only flag even for the\ndirectory, set this option.\nshowexec\nIf set, the execute permission bits of the file will be\nallowed only if the extension part of the name is .EXE, .COM,\nor .BAT. Not set by default.\nsys_immutable\nIf set,\nATTR_SYS\nattribute on FAT is handled as\nIMMUTABLE\nflag\non Linux. Not set by default.\nflush\nIf set, the filesystem will try to flush to disk more early\nthan normal. Not set by default.\nusefree\nUse the \"free clusters\" value stored on\nFSINFO\n. Itâll be used\nto determine number of free clusters without scanning disk.\nBut itâs not used by default, because recent Windows donât\nupdate it correctly in some case. If you are sure the \"free\nclusters\" on\nFSINFO\nis correct, by this option you can avoid\nscanning disk.\ndots\n,\nnodots\n,\ndotsOK=\n[\nyes\n|\nno\n]\nVarious misguided attempts to force Unix or DOS conventions\nonto a FAT filesystem.\nMount options for hfs\ncreator=\ncccc\n, type=\ncccc\nSet the creator/type values as shown by the MacOS finder used\nfor creating new files. Default values: '????'.\nuid=\nn\n, gid=\nn\nSet the owner and group of all files. (Default: the UID and\nGID of the current process.)\ndir_umask=\nn\n, file_umask=\nn\n, umask=\nn\nSet the umask used for all directories, all regular files, or\nall files and directories. Defaults to the umask of the\ncurrent process.\nsession=\nn\nSelect the CDROM session to mount. Defaults to leaving that\ndecision to the CDROM driver. This option will fail with\nanything but a CDROM as underlying device.\npart=\nn\nSelect partition number n from the device. Only makes sense\nfor CDROMs. Defaults to not parsing the partition table at\nall.\nquiet\nDonât complain about invalid mount options.\nMount options for hpfs\nuid=\nvalue\nand\ngid=\nvalue\nSet the owner and group of all files. (Default: the UID and\nGID of the current process.)\numask=\nvalue\nSet the umask (the bitmask of the permissions that are\nnot\npresent). The default is the umask of the current process. The\nvalue is given in octal.\ncase=\n{\nlower\n|\nasis\n}\nConvert all files names to lower case, or leave them.\n(Default:\ncase=lower\n.)\nconv=\nmode\nThis option is obsolete and may fail or being ignored.\nnocheck\nDo not abort mounting when certain consistency checks fail.\nMount options for iso9660\nISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be\nused on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs.\nSee also the\nudf\nfilesystem.)\nNormal\niso9660\nfilenames appear in an 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like\nrestrictions on filename length), and in addition all characters\nare in upper case. Also there is no field for file ownership,\nprotection, number of links, provision for block/character\ndevices, etc.\nRock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these\nUNIX-like features. Basically there are extensions to each\ndirectory record that supply all of the additional information,\nand when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem is indistinguishable\nfrom a normal UNIX filesystem (except that it is read-only, of\ncourse).\nnorock\nDisable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if available.\nCf.\nmap\n.\nnojoliet\nDisable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions, even if\navailable. Cf.\nmap\n.\ncheck=\n{\nr\n[\nelaxed\n]|\ns\n[\ntrict\n]}\nWith\ncheck=relaxed\n, a filename is first converted to lower\ncase before doing the lookup. This is probably only meaningful\ntogether with\nnorock\nand\nmap=normal\n. (Default:\ncheck=strict\n.)\nuid=\nvalue\nand\ngid=\nvalue\nGive all files in the filesystem the indicated user or group\nid, possibly overriding the information found in the Rock\nRidge extensions.

This option is only valid during a\nremount, when the volume is mounted read-write. The\nresize\nkeyword with no value will grow the volume to the full size of\nthe partition.\nnointegrity\nDo not write to the journal. The primary use of this option is\nto allow for higher performance when restoring a volume from\nbackup media.

If the\nmsdos\nfilesystem detects an\ninconsistency, it reports an error and sets the file system\nread-only. The filesystem can be made writable again by remounting\nit.\nMount options for ncpfs\nJust like\nnfs\n, the\nncpfs\nimplementation expects a binary argument\n(a\nstruct ncp_mount_data\n) to the\nmount(2)\nsystem call. This\nargument is constructed by\nncpmount\n(8) and the current version of\nmount\n(2.12) does not know anything about ncpfs.\nMount options for ntfs3\nThe ntfs3 kernel driver provides below mount options - as\ndocumented in\nhttps://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ntfs3.html\niocharset=\nname\nThis option informs the driver how to interpret path strings\nand translate them to Unicode and back.

By default, all meta-files are hidden.\nprealloc\nPreallocate space for files excessively when file size is\nincreasing on writes. Decreases fragmentation in case of\nparallel write operations to different files.\nacl\nSupport POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists). Effective if\nsupported by Kernel. Not to be confused with NTFS ACLs. The\noption specified as acl enables support for POSIX ACLs.\nMount options for overlay\nSince Linux 3.18 the overlay pseudo filesystem implements a union\nmount for other filesystems.\nAn overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an\nupper\nfilesystem and a\nlower\nfilesystem. When a name exists in both\nfilesystems, the object in the upper filesystem is visible while\nthe object in the lower filesystem is either hidden or, in the\ncase of directories, merged with the upper object.\nThe lower filesystem can be any filesystem supported by Linux and\ndoes not need to be writable. The lower filesystem can even be\nanother overlayfs. The upper filesystem will normally be writable\nand if it is it must support the creation of trusted.* extended\nattributes, and must provide a valid d_type in readdir responses,\nso NFS is not suitable.\nA read-only overlay of two read-only filesystems may use any\nfilesystem type. The options\nlowerdir\nand\nupperdir\nare combined\ninto a merged directory by using:\nmount -t overlay  overlay  \\\n-olowerdir=/lower,upperdir=/upper,workdir=/work  /merged\nlowerdir=\ndirectory\nAny filesystem, does not need to be on a writable filesystem.\nupperdir=\ndirectory\nThe upperdir is normally on a writable filesystem.\nworkdir=\ndirectory\nThe workdir needs to be an empty directory on the same\nfilesystem as upperdir.\nuserxattr\nUse the \"\nuser.overlay.\n\" xattr namespace instead of\n\"\ntrusted.overlay.\n\". This is useful for unprivileged mounting\nof overlayfs.\nredirect_dir=\n{\non\n|\noff\n|\nfollow\n|\nnofollow\n}\nIf the\nredirect_dir\nfeature is enabled, then the directory\nwill be copied up (but not the contents). Then the\n\"{\ntrusted\n|\nuser\n}.overlay.redirect\" extended attribute is set to\nthe path of the original location from the root of the\noverlay. Finally the directory is moved to the new location.\non\nRedirects are enabled.\noff\nRedirects are not created and only followed if\n\"redirect_always_follow\" feature is enabled in the\nkernel/module config.\nfollow\nRedirects are not created, but followed.\nnofollow\nRedirects are not created and not followed (equivalent to\n\"redirect_dir=off\" if \"redirect_always_follow\" feature is\nnot enabled).\nindex=\n{\non\n|\noff\n}\nInode index. If this feature is disabled and a file with\nmultiple hard links is copied up, then this will \"break\" the\nlink. Changes will not be propagated to other names referring\nto the same inode.\nuuid=\n{\non\n|\noff\n}\nCan be used to replace UUID of the underlying filesystem in\nfile handles with null, and effectively disable UUID checks.\nThis can be useful in case the underlying disk is copied and\nthe UUID of this copy is changed. This is only applicable if\nall lower/upper/work directories are on the same filesystem,\notherwise it will fallback to normal behaviour.\nnfs_export=\n{\non\n|\noff\n}\nWhen the underlying filesystems supports NFS export and the\n\"nfs_export\" feature is enabled, an overlay filesystem may be\nexported to NFS.\nWith the \"nfs_export\" feature, on copy_up of any lower object,\nan index entry is created under the index directory. The index\nentry name is the hexadecimal representation of the copy up\norigin file handle. For a non-directory object, the index\nentry is a hard link to the upper inode. For a directory\nobject, the index entry has an extended attribute\n\"{\ntrusted\n|\nuser\n}.overlay.upper\" with an encoded file handle of\nthe upper directory inode.\nWhen encoding a file handle from an overlay filesystem object,\nthe following rules apply\nâ¢   For a non-upper object, encode a lower file handle\nfrom lower inode\nâ¢   For an indexed object, encode a lower file handle from\ncopy_up origin\nâ¢   For a pure-upper object and for an existing\nnon-indexed upper object, encode an upper file handle\nfrom upper inode\nThe encoded overlay file handle includes\nâ¢   Header including path type information (e.g.\nlower/upper)\nâ¢   UUID of the underlying filesystem\nâ¢   Underlying filesystem encoding of underlying inode\nThis encoding format is identical to the encoding format of\nfile handles that are stored in extended attribute\n\"{\ntrusted\n|\nuser\n}.overlay.origin\". When decoding an overlay file\nhandle, the following steps are followed\nâ¢   Find underlying layer by UUID and path type\ninformation.\nâ¢   Decode the underlying filesystem file handle to\nunderlying dentry.\nâ¢   For a lower file handle, lookup the handle in index\ndirectory by name.\nâ¢   If a whiteout is found in index, return\nESTALE\n. This\nrepresents an overlay object that was deleted after\nits file handle was encoded.\nâ¢   For a non-directory, instantiate a disconnected\noverlay dentry from the decoded underlying dentry, the\npath type and index inode, if found.\nâ¢   For a directory, use the connected underlying decoded\ndentry, path type and index, to lookup a connected\noverlay dentry.\nDecoding a non-directory file handle may return a disconnected\ndentry. copy_up of that disconnected dentry will create an\nupper index entry with no upper alias.\nWhen overlay filesystem has multiple lower layers, a middle\nlayer directory may have a \"redirect\" to lower directory.\nBecause middle layer \"redirects\" are not indexed, a lower file\nhandle that was encoded from the \"redirect\" origin directory,\ncannot be used to find the middle or upper layer directory.\nSimilarly, a lower file handle that was encoded from a\ndescendant of the \"redirect\" origin directory, cannot be used\nto reconstruct a connected overlay path. To mitigate the cases\nof directories that cannot be decoded from a lower file\nhandle, these directories are copied up on encode and encoded\nas an upper file handle. On an overlay filesystem with no\nupper layer this mitigation cannot be used NFS export in this\nsetup requires turning off redirect follow (e.g.\n\"\nredirect_dir=nofollow\n\").\nThe overlay filesystem does not support non-directory\nconnectable file handles, so exporting with the\nsubtree_check\nexportfs configuration will cause failures to lookup files\nover NFS.\nWhen the NFS export feature is enabled, all directory index\nentries are verified on mount time to check that upper file\nhandles are not stale. This verification may cause significant\noverhead in some cases.\nNote: the mount options\nindex=off,nfs_export=on\nare\nconflicting for a read-write mount and will result in an\nerror.\nxino=\n{\non\n|\noff\n|\nauto\n}\nThe \"xino\" feature composes a unique object identifier from\nthe real object st_ino and an underlying fsid index. The\n\"xino\" feature uses the high inode number bits for fsid,\nbecause the underlying filesystems rarely use the high inode\nnumber bits. In case the underlying inode number does overflow\ninto the high xino bits, overlay filesystem will fall back to\nthe non xino behavior for that inode.\nFor a detailed description of the effect of this option please\nrefer to\nhttps://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html\nmetacopy=\n{\non\n|\noff\n}\nWhen metadata only copy up feature is enabled, overlayfs will\nonly copy up metadata (as opposed to whole file), when a\nmetadata specific operation like chown/chmod is performed.\nFull file will be copied up later when file is opened for\nWRITE operation.\nIn other words, this is delayed data copy up operation and\ndata is copied up when there is a need to actually modify\ndata.\nvolatile\nVolatile mounts are not guaranteed to survive a crash. It is\nstrongly recommended that volatile mounts are only used if\ndata written to the overlay can be recreated without\nsignificant effort.\nThe advantage of mounting with the \"volatile\" option is that\nall forms of sync calls to the upper filesystem are omitted.\nIn order to avoid a giving a false sense of safety, the syncfs\n(and fsync) semantics of volatile mounts are slightly\ndifferent than that of the rest of VFS. If any writeback error\noccurs on the upperdirâs filesystem after a volatile mount\ntakes place, all sync functions will return an error. Once\nthis condition is reached, the filesystem will not recover,\nand every subsequent sync call will return an error, even if\nthe upperdir has not experience a new error since the last\nsync call.\nWhen overlay is mounted with \"volatile\" option, the directory\n\"$workdir/work/incompat/volatile\" is created. During next\nmount, overlay checks for this directory and refuses to mount\nif present. This is a strong indicator that user should throw\naway upper and work directories and create fresh one. In very\nlimited cases where the user knows that the system has not\ncrashed and contents of upperdir are intact, The \"volatile\"\ndirectory can be removed.\nMount options for reiserfs\nReiserfs is a journaling filesystem.\nconv\nInstructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount a version 3.5\nfilesystem, using the 3.6 format for newly created objects.\nThis filesystem will no longer be compatible with reiserfs 3.5\ntools.\nhash=\n{\nrupasov\n|\ntea\n|\nr5\n|\ndetect\n}\nChoose which hash function reiserfs will use to find files\nwithin directories.\nrupasov\nA hash invented by Yury Yu.

For\ndevice reuse, signatures have to be either used by all mounts\nof a device or by none. Optional.\nverity.oncorruption=\n{\nignore\n|\nrestart\n|\npanic\n}\nInstruct the kernel to ignore, reboot or panic when corruption\nis detected.

The kernel will\nverify that the root hash is signed by a key from the kernel\nkeyring if roothashsig is used.\nLOOP-DEVICE SUPPORT\ntop\nOne further possible type is a mount via the loop device. For\nexample, the command\nmount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop3\nwill set up the loop device\n/dev/loop3\nto correspond to the file\n/tmp/disk.img\n, and then mount this device on\n/mnt\n.\nIf no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an option '\n-o\nloop\n' is given), then\nmount\nwill try to find some unused loop\ndevice and use that, for example\nmount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o loop\nThe\nmount\ncommand\nautomatically\ncreates a loop device from a\nregular file if a filesystem type is not specified or the\nfilesystem is known for libblkid, for example:\nmount /tmp/disk.img /mnt\nmount -t ext4 /tmp/disk.img /mnt\nThis type of mount knows about three options, namely\nloop\n,\noffset\nand\nsizelimit\n, that are really options to\nlosetup(8)\n. (These\noptions can be used in addition to those specific to the\nfilesystem type.)\nSince Linux 2.6.25 auto-destruction of loop devices is supported,\nmeaning that any loop device allocated by\nmount\nwill be freed by\numount\nindependently of\n/etc/mtab\n.\nYou can also free a loop device by hand, using\nlosetup -d\nor\numount -d\n.\nSince util-linux v2.29,\nmount\nre-uses the loop device rather than\ninitializing a new device if the same backing file is already used\nfor some loop device with the same offset and sizelimit. This is\nnecessary to avoid a filesystem corruption.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nmount\nhas the following exit status values (the bits can be ORed):\n0\nsuccess\n1\nincorrect invocation or permissions\n2\nsystem error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop\ndevices)\n4\ninternal\nmount\nbug\n8\nuser interrupt\n16\nproblems writing or locking\n/etc/mtab\n32\nmount failure\n64\nsome mount succeeded\nThe command\nmount -a\nreturns 0 (all succeeded), 32 (all\nfailed), or 64 (some failed, some succeeded).\n126\nfailed to execute external /sbin/mount.<type> mount helper\n(since util-linux v2.41)\nEXTERNAL HELPERS\ntop\nThe syntax of external mount helpers is:\n/sbin/mount.\nsuffix spec dir\n[\n-sfnv\n] [\n-N\nnamespace\n] [\n-o\noptions\n]\n[\n-t\ntype\n.\nsubtype\n]\nwhere the\nsuffix\nis the filesystem type and the\n-sfnvoN\noptions\nhave the same meaning as the normal mount options.

It understands GPT, MBR, Sun, SGI and BSD\npartition tables.\nBlock devices can be divided into one or more logical disks called\npartitions\n. This division is recorded in the\npartition table\n,\nusually found in sector 0 of the disk. (In the BSD world one talks\nabout `disk slices' and a `disklabel'.)\nAll partitioning is driven by device I/O limits (the topology) by\ndefault.\nfdisk\nis able to optimize the disk layout for a 4K-sector\nsize and use an alignment offset on modern devices for MBR and\nGPT. It is always a good idea to follow\nfdisk\n's defaults as the\ndefault values (e.g., first and last partition sectors) and\npartition sizes specified by the +/-<size>{M,G,...} notation are\nalways aligned according to the device properties.\nCHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing is deprecated and not used\nby default. Please, do not follow old articles and recommendations\nwith\nfdisk -S <n> -H <n>\nadvice for SSD or 4K-sector devices.\nNote that\npartx(8)\nprovides a rich interface for scripts to print\ndisk layouts,\nfdisk\nis mostly designed for humans. Backward\ncompatibility in the output of\nfdisk\nis not guaranteed. The input\n(the commands) should always be backward compatible.\nOPTIONS\ntop\n-b\n,\n--sector-size\nsectorsize\nSpecify the sector size of the disk. Valid values are 512,\n1024, 2048, and 4096. The kernel is aware of the sector size\nfor regular block devices. Use this option only on very old\nkernels, when working with disk images, or to override the\nkernelâs default sector size. Since util-linux-2.17,\nfdisk\ndistinguishes between logical and physical sector size. This\noption changes both sector sizes to the specified\nsectorsize\n.\n-B\n,\n--protect-boot\nDonât erase the beginning of the first disk sector when\ncreating a new disk label. This feature is supported for GPT\nand MBR.\n-c\n,\n--compatibility\n[\n=\nmode\n]\nSpecify the compatibility mode, 'dos' or 'nondos'. The default\nis non-DOS mode. For backward compatibility, it is possible to\nuse the option without the\nmode\nargument â then the default is\nused. Note that the optional\nmode\nargument cannot be separated\nfrom the\n-c\noption by a space, the correct form is for example\n-c\n=\ndos\n.\n-L\n,\n--color\n[\n=\nwhen\n]\nColorize the output. The optional argument\nwhen\ncan be\nauto\n,\nnever\nor\nalways\n. If the\nwhen\nargument is omitted, it defaults\nto\nauto\n. The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in\ndefault see the\n--help\noutput. See also the\nCOLORS\nsection.\n-l\n,\n--list\nList the partition tables for the specified devices and then\nexit.\nIf no devices are given, the devices mentioned in\n/proc/partitions\n(if this file exists) are used. Devices are\nalways listed in the order in which they are specified on the\ncommand-line, or by the kernel listed in\n/proc/partitions\n.\n-x\n,\n--list-details\nLike\n--list\n, but provides more details.\n--lock\n[\n=\nmode\n]\nUse an exclusive BSD lock for the device or file that is\noperated upon. The optional argument\nmode\ncan be\nyes\n(\n1\n),\nno\n(\n0\n), or\nnonblock\n. If the\nmode\nargument is omitted, it defaults\nto\nyes\n. This option overrides the environment variable\n$LOCK_BLOCK_DEVICE\n. The default is to not use any lock at all,\nbut using a lock is recommended to avoid collisions with\nsystemd-udevd(8)\nor other tools.\n-n\n,\n--noauto-pt\nDonât automatically create a default partition table on empty\ndevice. The partition table has to be explicitly created by\nuser (by command like 'o', 'g', etc.).\n-o\n,\n--output\nlist\nSpecify which output columns to print. Use\n--help\nto get a\nlist of all supported columns.\nThe default list of columns may be extended if\nlist\nis\nspecified in the format\n+list\n(e.g.,\n-o +UUID\n).\n-s\n,\n--getsz\nPrint the size in 512-byte sectors of each given block device.\nThis option is DEPRECATED in favour of\nblockdev(8)\n.\n-t\n,\n--type\ntype\nEnable support only for disklabels of the specified\ntype\n, and\ndisable support for all other types.\n-u\n,\n--units\n[\n=\nunit\n]\nWhen listing partition tables, show sizes in 'sectors' or in\n'cylinders'. The default is to show sizes in sectors. For\nbackward compatibility, it is possible to use the option\nwithout the\nunit\nargument â then the default is used. Note\nthat the optional\nunit\nargument cannot be separated from the\n-u\noption by a space, the correct form is for example\n'\n-u=\ncylinders\n'.\n-C\n,\n--cylinders\nnumber\nSpecify the\nnumber\nof cylinders of the disk. I have no idea\nwhy anybody would want to do so.\n-H\n,\n--heads\nnumber\nSpecify the number of heads of the disk. (Not the physical\nnumber, of course, but the number used for partition tables.)\nReasonable values are 255 and 16.\n-S\n,\n--sectors\nnumber\nSpecify the number of sectors per track of the disk. (Not the\nphysical number, of course, but the number used for partition\ntables.) A reasonable value is 63.\n-w\n,\n--wipe\nwhen\nWipe filesystem, RAID and partition-table signatures from the\ndevice, in order to avoid possible collisions. The argument\nwhen\ncan be\nauto\n,\nnever\nor\nalways\n. When this option is not\ngiven, the default is\nauto\n, in which case signatures are wiped\nonly when in interactive mode. In all cases detected\nsignatures are reported by warning messages before a new\npartition table is created. See also\nwipefs(8)\ncommand.\n-W\n,\n--wipe-partitions\nwhen\nWipe filesystem, RAID and partition-table signatures from a\nnewly created partitions, in order to avoid possible\ncollisions. The argument\nwhen\ncan be\nauto\n,\nnever\nor\nalways\n.\nWhen this option is not given, the default is\nauto\n, in which\ncase signatures are wiped only when in interactive mode and\nafter confirmation by user. In all cases detected signatures\nare reported by warning messages before a new partition is\ncreated. See also\nwipefs(8)\ncommand.\n-h\n,\n--help\nDisplay help text and exit.\n-V\n,\n--version\nDisplay version and exit.\nDEVICES\ntop\nThe\ndevice\nis usually\n/dev/sda\n,\n/dev/sdb\nor so. A device name\nrefers to the entire disk. Old systems without libata (a library\nused inside the Linux kernel to support ATA host controllers and\ndevices) make a difference between IDE and SCSI disks. In such\ncases the device name will be\n/dev/hd*\n(IDE) or\n/dev/sd*\n(SCSI).\nThe\npartition\nis a device name followed by a partition number. For\nexample,\n/dev/sda1\nis the first partition on the first hard disk\nin the system. See also Linux kernel documentation (the\nDocumentation/admin-guide/devices.txt\nfile).\nSIZES\ntop\nThe \"last sector\" dialog accepts partition size specified by\nnumber of sectors or by +/-<size>{K,B,M,G,...} notation.\nIf the size is prefixed by '+' then it is interpreted as relative\nto the partition first sector. If the size is prefixed by '-' then\nit is interpreted as relative to the high limit (last available\nsector for the partition).\nIn the case the size is specified in bytes, then the number may be\nfollowed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (1024 bytes), MiB\n(1024*1024 bytes), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB.\nThe \"iB\" is optional, e.g., \"K\" has the same meaning as \"KiB\".\nThe relative sizes if specified with multiplicative suffixes (e.g.\n+100MiB) are always aligned according to device I/O limits. The\n+/-<size>{K,B,M,G,...} notation is recommended.\nThe last sector of the partition is strictly calculated as <start>\n+ <size> (without -1) if the size is specified by the +<sectors>\nnotation. In this case, the size is not aligned to the device I/O\nlimits.\nFor backward compatibility\nfdisk\nalso accepts the suffixes KB\n(1000 bytes), MB (1000*1000 bytes), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB,\nZB and YB. These 10^N suffixes are deprecated.\nSCRIPT FILES\ntop\nfdisk\nallows reading (by 'I' command)\nsfdisk(8)\ncompatible script\nfiles. The script is applied to in-memory partition table, and\nthen it is possible to modify the partition table before you write\nit to the device.\nAnd vice-versa it is possible to write the current in-memory disk\nlayout to the script file by command 'O'.\nThe script files are compatible between\ncfdisk(8)\n,\nsfdisk(8)\n,\nfdisk\nand other libfdisk applications. For more details see\nsfdisk(8)\n.\nDISK LABELS\ntop\nGPT (GUID Partition Table)\nGPT is modern standard for the layout of the partition table.\nGPT uses 64-bit logical block addresses, checksums, UUIDs and\nnames for partitions and an unlimited number of partitions\n(although the number of partitions is usually restricted to\n128 in many partitioning tools).\nNote that the first sector is still reserved for a\nprotective\nMBR\nin the GPT specification. It prevents MBR-only\npartitioning tools from mis-recognizing and overwriting GPT\ndisks.\nGPT is always a better choice than MBR, especially on modern\nhardware with a UEFI boot loader.\nDOS-type (MBR)\nA DOS-type partition table can describe an unlimited number of\npartitions. In sector 0 there is room for the description of 4\npartitions (called `primary'). One of these may be an extended\npartition; this is a box holding logical partitions, with\ndescriptors found in a linked list of sectors, each preceding\nthe corresponding logical partitions. The four primary\npartitions, present or not, get numbers 1-4. Logical\npartitions are numbered starting from 5.\nIn a DOS-type partition table the starting offset and the size\nof each partition is stored in two ways: as an absolute number\nof sectors (given in 32 bits), and as a\nCylinders/Heads/Sectors\ntriple (given in 10+8+6 bits). The\nformer is OK â with 512-byte sectors this will work up to 2\nTB. The latter has two problems. First, these C/H/S fields can\nbe filled only when the number of heads and the number of\nsectors per track are known. And second, even if we know what\nthese numbers should be, the 24 bits that are available do not\nsuffice. DOS uses C/H/S only, Windows uses both, Linux never\nuses C/H/S. The\nC/H/S addressing is deprecated\nand may be\nunsupported in some later\nfdisk\nversion.\nPlease, read the DOS-mode section if you want DOS-compatible\npartitions. fdisk\ndoes not care about cylinder boundaries by\ndefault.\nBSD/Sun-type\nA BSD/Sun disklabel can describe 8 partitions, the third of\nwhich should be a `whole disk' partition. Do not start a\npartition that actually uses its first sector (like a swap\npartition) at cylinder 0, since that will destroy the\ndisklabel. Note that a\nBSD label\nis usually nested within a\nDOS partition.\nIRIX/SGI-type\nAn IRIX/SGI disklabel can describe 16 partitions, the eleventh\nof which should be an entire `volume' partition, while the\nninth should be labeled `volume header'. The volume header\nwill also cover the partition table, i.e., it starts at block\nzero and extends by default over five cylinders. The remaining\nspace in the volume header may be used by header directory\nentries. No partitions may overlap with the volume header.\nAlso do not change its type or make some filesystem on it,\nsince you will lose the partition table. Use this type of\nlabel only when working with Linux on IRIX/SGI machines or\nIRIX/SGI disks under Linux.\nA\nsync(2)\nand an ioctl(BLKRRPART) (rereading the partition\ntable from disk) are performed before exiting when the\npartition table has been updated.\nDOS MODE AND DOS 6.X WARNING\ntop\nNote that all this is deprecated. You donât have to care about\nthings like geometry and cylinders on modern operating systems. If\nyou really want DOS-compatible partitioning then you have to\nenable DOS mode and cylinder units by using the '-c=dos\n-u=cylinders' fdisk command-line options.\nThe DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the first\nsector of the data area of the partition, and treats this\ninformation as more reliable than the information in the partition\ntable. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear the first 512 bytes\nof the data area of a partition whenever a size change occurs. DOS\nFORMAT will look at this extra information even if the /U flag is\ngiven â we consider this a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.\nThe bottom line is that if you use\nfdisk\nor\ncfdisk(8)\nto change\nthe size of a DOS partition table entry, then you must also use\ndd(1)\nto\nzero the first 512 bytes\nof that partition before using\nDOS FORMAT to format the partition. For example, if you were using\nfdisk\nto make a DOS partition table entry for\n/dev/sda1\n, then\n(after exiting\nfdisk\nand rebooting Linux so that the partition\ntable information is valid) you would use the command\ndd\nif=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 bs=512 count=1\nto zero the first 512\nbytes of the partition.\nfdisk\nusually obtains the disk geometry automatically. This is not\nnecessarily the physical disk geometry (indeed, modern disks do\nnot really have anything like a physical geometry, certainly not\nsomething that can be described in the simplistic\nCylinders/Heads/Sectors form), but it is the disk geometry that\nMS-DOS uses for the partition table.\nUsually all goes well by default, and there are no problems if\nLinux is the only system on the disk. However, if the disk has to\nbe shared with other operating systems, it is often a good idea to\nlet an\nfdisk\nfrom another operating system make at least one\npartition. When Linux boots it looks at the partition table, and\ntries to deduce what (fake) geometry is required for good\ncooperation with other systems.\nWhenever a partition table is printed out in DOS mode, a\nconsistency check is performed on the partition table entries.\nThis check verifies that the physical and logical start and end\npoints are identical, and that each partition starts and ends on a\ncylinder boundary (except for the first partition).\nSome versions of MS-DOS create a first partition which does not\nbegin on a cylinder boundary, but on sector 2 of the first\ncylinder. Partitions beginning in cylinder 1 cannot begin on a\ncylinder boundary, but this is unlikely to cause difficulty unless\nyou have OS/2 on your machine.\nFor best results, you should always use an OS-specific partition\ntable program. For example, you should make DOS partitions with\nthe DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions with the Linux\nfdisk\nor\nLinux\ncfdisk(8)\nprograms.\nCOLORS\ntop\nThe output colorization is implemented by\nterminal-colors.d(5)\nfunctionality.

{"text": "lsblk(8) - Linux manual page\nman7.org\n> Linux >\nman-pages\nLinux/UNIX system programming training\nlsblk(8) — Linux manual page\nNAME\n|\nSYNOPSIS\n|\nDESCRIPTION\n|\nOPTIONS\n|\nEXIT STATUS\n|\nENVIRONMENT\n|\nNOTES\n|\nAUTHORS\n|\nSEE ALSO\n|\nREPORTING BUGS\n|\nAVAILABILITY\nLSBLK\n(8)                  System Administration\nLSBLK\n(8)\nNAME\ntop\nlsblk - list block devices\nSYNOPSIS\ntop\nlsblk\n[options] [\ndevice\n...]\nDESCRIPTION\ntop\nlsblk\nlists information about all available or the specified block\ndevices. The\nlsblk\ncommand reads the\nsysfs\nfilesystem and\nudev db\nto gather information. If the udev db is not available or\nlsblk\nis\ncompiled without udev support, then it tries to read LABELs, UUIDs\nand filesystem types from the block device. In this case root\npermissions are necessary.\nBy default, the command prints all block devices (except RAM\ndisks) in a tree-like format. The same device can be repeated in\nthe tree if it relates to other devices. The\n--merge\noption is\nrecommended for more complicated setups to gather groups of\ndevices and describe complex N:M relationships.\nThe tree-like output (or\nchildren[]\narray in the JSON output) is\nenabled only if NAME column it present in the output or when\n--tree\ncommand line option is used. See also\n--nodeps\nand\n--list\nto control the tree formatting.\nThe default output, as well as the default output from options\nlike\n--fs\nand\n--topology\n, is subject to change. So whenever\npossible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.\nAlways explicitly define expected columns by using\n--output\ncolumns-list\nand\n--list\nin environments where a stable output is\nrequired.\nUse\nlsblk --list-columns\nto get a list of all available columns.\nNote that\nlsblk\nmight be executed in time when\nudev\ndoes not have\nall information about recently added or modified devices yet. In\nthis case it is recommended to use\nudevadm settle\nbefore\nlsblk\nto\nsynchronize with udev.\nThe relationship between block devices and filesystems is not\nalways one-to-one. The filesystem may use more block devices, or\nthe same filesystem may be accessible by more paths. This is the\nreason why\nlsblk\nprovides MOUNTPOINT and MOUNTPOINTS (pl.)\ncolumns. The column MOUNTPOINT displays only one mount point\n(usually the last mounted instance of the filesystem), and the\ncolumn MOUNTPOINTS displays by multi-line cell all mount points\nassociated with the device.\nOPTIONS\ntop\n-A\n,\n--noempty\nDonât print empty devices.\n-a\n,\n--all\nDisable all built-in filters and list all empty devices and\nRAM disk devices too.\n-b\n,\n--bytes\nPrint sizes in bytes rather than in human-readable form.\nBy default, sizes are shown in units that are powers of 1024\nbytes. The formal abbreviations for these units (KiB, MiB,\nGiB, ...) are further shortened to just their first letter: K,\nM, G, ....\n-H\n,\n--list-columns\nList the columns that can be specified with the\n--output\noption. Can be used with\n--json\nor\n--raw\nto get the list in a\nmachine-readable format.\n-D\n,\n--discard\nPrint information about the discarding capabilities (TRIM,\nUNMAP) for each device.\n-d\n,\n--nodeps\nDo not print holder devices or slaves. For example,\nlsblk\n--nodeps /dev/sda\nprints information about the sda device\nonly.\n-E\n,\n--dedup\ncolumn\nUse\ncolumn\nas a de-duplication key to de-duplicate output\ntree. If the key is not available for the device, or the\ndevice is a partition and parental whole-disk device provides\nthe same key than the device is always printed.\nThe usual use case is to de-duplicate output on system\nmulti-path devices, for example by\n-E WWN\n.\n-e\n,\n--exclude\nlist\nExclude the devices specified by the comma-separated\nlist\nof\nmajor device numbers. Note that RAM disks (major=1) are\nexcluded by default if\n--all\nis not specified. The filter is\napplied to the top-level devices only. This may be confusing\nfor\n--list\noutput format where hierarchy of the devices is not\nobvious.\n-f\n,\n--fs\nOutput info about filesystems. This option is equivalent to\n-o\nNAME,FSTYPE,FSVER,LABEL,UUID,FSAVAIL,FSUSE%,MOUNTPOINTS\n. The\nauthoritative information about filesystems and raids is\nprovided by the\nblkid(8)\ncommand.\n--hyperlink\n[\n=\nwhen\n]\nPrint paths as terminal hyperlinks. The optional\nwhen\nargument\ncan be\nalways\n,\nnever\n, or\nauto\n. If the argument is omitted, it\ndefaults to\nauto\n, which means that hyperlinks will only be\nused when the output goes to a terminal.\n-I\n,\n--include\nlist\nInclude devices specified by the comma-separated\nlist\nof major\ndevice numbers. The filter is applied to the top-level devices\nonly. This may be confusing for\n--list\noutput format where\nhierarchy of the devices is not obvious.\n-i\n,\n--ascii\nUse ASCII characters for tree formatting.\n-J\n,\n--json\nUse JSON output format. Itâs strongly recommended to use\n--output\nand also\n--tree\nif necessary. Note that\nchildren[]\nis\nused only if NAME column or\n--tree\nis used.\n-l\n,\n--list\nProduce output in the form of a list. The output does not\nprovide information about relationships between devices and\nsince version 2.34 every device is printed only once if\n--pairs\nor\n--raw\nnot specified (the parsable outputs are\nmaintained in backwardly compatible way).\n-M\n,\n--merge\nGroup parents of sub-trees to provide more readable output for\nRAIDs and Multi-path devices. The tree-like output is\nrequired.\n-m\n,\n--perms\nOutput info about device owner, group and mode. This option is\nequivalent to\n-o NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE\n.\n-N\n,\n--nvme\nOutput info about NVMe devices only.\n-v\n,\n--virtio\nOutput info about virtio devices only.\n-n\n,\n--noheadings\nDo not print a header line.\n-o\n,\n--output\nlist\nSpecify which output columns to print. Use\n--list-columns\nto\nget a list of all supported columns. The columns may affect\ntree-like output. The default is to use tree for the column\n'NAME' (see also\n--tree\n).\nThe default list of columns may be extended if\nlist\nis\nspecified in the format\n+list\n(e.g.,\nlsblk -o +UUID\n).\n-O\n,\n--output-all\nOutput all available columns.\n-P\n,\n--pairs\nProduce output in the form of key=\"value\" pairs. The output\nlines are still ordered by dependencies. All potentially\nunsafe value characters are hex-escaped (\\x<code>). See also\noption\n--shell\n.\n-p\n,\n--paths\nPrint full device paths.\n-Q\n,\n--filter\nexpression\nPrint only the devices that meet the conditions specified by\nexpression\n. The filter is assessed prior to\nlsblk\ncollecting\ndata for all output columns. Only the necessary data for the\nlazy evaluation of the expression is retrieved from the\nsystem. This approach can enhance performance when compared to\npost-filtering, as commonly done by tools such as\ngrep(1)\n.\nThis feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also\nscols-filter(5)\n.\nFor example, to exclude sda and sdb, but print everything else\n('!~' is a negative regular-expression matching operator):\nlsblk --filter 'NAME !~ \"sd[ab]\"'\n--highlight\nexpression\nColorize lines matching\nexpression\n.\nThis feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also\nscols-filter(5)\n.\n--ct\nname\n[\n:\nparameter\n[\n:\nfunction\n]]\nDefine a custom counter. Custom counters are printed after the\nstandard output. The\nname\nis the custom name of the counter,\nthe optional\nparameter\nis the name of the column to be used\nfor the counter, and the optional\nfunction\nspecifies the\naggregation function. Supported functions are:\ncount\n,\nmin\n,\nmax\n,\nsum\n. The default function is\ncount\n. If\nparameter\nis not\nspecified, then the counter counts the number of lines.\nThis feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also\n--ct-filter\n.\nFor example,\n--ct MyCounter:SIZE:sum\nreports the total of the\nSIZE values. To report the number of SATA disks, one can use:\nlsblk --ct-filter 'TYPE==\"disk\" && TRAN==\"sata\"' \\\n--ct \"Number of SATA devices\"\n--ct-filter\nexpression\nDefine a restriction for the next counter.\nThis feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also\n--ct\nand\nscols-filter(5)\n.\nFor example, to aggregate sizes by device type:\nlsblk --ct-filter 'TYPE==\"part\"' --ct Partitions:SIZE:sum \\\n--ct-filter 'TYPE==\"disk\"' --ct WholeDisks:SIZE:sum\n-r\n,\n--raw\nProduce output in raw format. The output lines are still\nordered by dependencies. All potentially unsafe characters are\nhex-escaped (\\x<code>) in the NAME, KNAME, LABEL, PARTLABEL\nand MOUNTPOINT columns.\n-S\n,\n--scsi\nOutput info about SCSI devices only. All partitions, slaves\nand holder devices are ignored.\n-s\n,\n--inverse\nPrint dependencies in inverse order. If the\n--list\noutput is\nrequested then the lines are still ordered by dependencies.\n-T\n,\n--tree\n[\n=\ncolumn\n]\nForce tree-like output format. If\ncolumn\nis specified, then a\ntree is printed in the column. The default is NAME column.\n-t\n,\n--topology\nOutput info about block-device topology. This option is\nequivalent to\n-o\nNAME,ALIGNMENT,MIN-IO,OPT-IO,PHY-SEC,LOG-SEC,ROTA,SCHED,RQ-SIZE,RA,WSAME\n.\n-w\n,\n--width\nnumber\nSpecifies output width as a number of characters. The default\nis the number of the terminal columns, and if not executed on\na terminal, then output width is not restricted at all by\ndefault. This option also forces\nlsblk\nto assume that terminal\ncontrol characters and unsafe characters are not allowed. The\nexpected use-case is for example when\nlsblk\nis used by the\nwatch(1)\ncommand.\n-x\n,\n--sort\ncolumn\nSort output lines by\ncolumn\n. This option enables\n--list\noutput\nformat by default. It is possible to use the option\n--tree\nto\nforce tree-like output and than the tree branches are sorted\nby the\ncolumn\n.\n-y\n,\n--shell\nThe column name will be modified to contain only characters\nallowed for shell variable identifiers, for example, MIN_IO\nand FSUSE_PCT instead of MIN-IO and FSUSE%. This is usable,\nfor example, with\n--pairs\n. Note that this feature has been\nautomatically enabled for\n--pairs\nin version 2.37, but due to\ncompatibility issues, now itâs necessary to request this\nbehavior by\n--shell\n.\n-z\n,\n--zoned\nPrint the zone related information for each device.\n--sysroot\ndirectory\nGather data for a Linux instance other than the instance from\nwhich the\nlsblk\ncommand is issued. The specified directory is\nthe system root of the Linux instance to be inspected. The\nreal device nodes in the target directory can be replaced by\ntext files with udev attributes.\n--properties-by\nlist\nThis option specifies the methods used by\nlsblk\nto gather\ninformation about filesystems and partition tables. The list\nis a comma-separated list of method names. The default setting\nis \"file,udev,blkid\". The supported methods are:\nudev\nReads data from udev DB. If unsuccessful, it continues to\nthe next probing method.\nblkid\nReads data directly from the device using libblkid. If\nunsuccessful, it continues to the next probing method.\nfile\nReads data from a file. This method is only used if the\n--sysroot option is specified. This method always stops\nprobing if used.\nnone\nDoes not probe. This method always stops probing.\n-h\n,\n--help\nDisplay help text and exit.\n-V\n,\n--version\nDisplay version and exit.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\n0\nsuccess\n1\nfailure\n32\nnone of specified devices found\n64\nsome specified devices found, some not found\nENVIRONMENT\ntop\nLSBLK_DEBUG\n=all\nenables\nlsblk\ndebug output.\nLIBBLKID_DEBUG\n=all\nenables\nlibblkid\ndebug output.\nLIBMOUNT_DEBUG\n=all\nenables\nlibmount\ndebug output.\nLIBSMARTCOLS_DEBUG\n=all\nenables\nlibsmartcols\ndebug output.\nLIBSMARTCOLS_DEBUG_PADDING\n=on\nuse visible padding characters.\nNOTES\ntop\nFor partitions, some information (e.g., queue attributes) is\ninherited from the parent device.\nThe\nlsblk\ncommand needs to be able to look up each block device by\nmajor:minor numbers, which is done by using\n/sys/dev/block\n.

There are some synonymous options, which are functionally\nidentical, due to the many standards and\nps\nimplementations that\nthis\nps\nis compatible with.\nBy default,\nps\nselects all processes with the same effective user\nID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same\nterminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID),\nthe terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the\ncumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the\nexecutable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.\nThe use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to\nthe default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND)\ninstead of the executable name.  You can override this with the\nPS_FORMAT\nenvironment variable.  The use of BSD-style options will\nalso change the process selection to include processes on other\nterminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be\ndescribed as setting the selection to be the set of all processes\nfiltered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a\nterminal.  These effects are not considered when options are\ndescribed as being \"identical\" below, so\n-M\nwill be considered\nidentical to\nZ\nand so on.\nExcept as described below, process selection options are additive.\nThe default selection is discarded, and then the selected\nprocesses are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A\nprocess will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection\ncriteria.\nEXAMPLES\ntop\nTo see every process on the system using standard syntax:\nps -e\nps -ef\nps -eF\nps -ely\nTo see every process on the system using BSD syntax:\nps ax\nps axu\nTo print a process tree:\nps -ejH\nps axjf\nTo get info about threads:\nps -eLf\nps axms\nTo get security info:\nps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label\nps axZ\nps -eM\nTo see every process running as root (real & effective ID) in user\nformat:\nps -U root -u root u\nTo see every process with a user-defined format:\nps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm\nps axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm\nps -Ao pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan\nPrint only the process IDs of syslogd:\nps -C syslogd -o pid=\nPrint only the name of PID 42:\nps -q 42 -o comm=\nSIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION\ntop\na\nLift the BSD-style \"only yourself\" restriction, which is\nimposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style\n(without \"-\") options are used or when the\nps\npersonality\nsetting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this\nmanner is in addition to the set of processes selected by\nother means.  An alternate description is that this option\ncauses\nps\nto list all processes with a terminal (tty), or\nto list all processes when used together with the\nx\noption.\n-A\nSelect all processes.

Selection by\nsession is specified by many standards, but selection by\neffective group is the logical behavior that several other\noperating systems use.  This\nps\nwill select by session when\nthe list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID\nnumbers will work only when some group names are also\nspecified.  See the\n-s\nand\n--group\noptions.\n--Group\ngrplist\nSelect by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to\n-G\n.\n--group\ngrplist\nSelect by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects\nthe processes whose effective group name or ID is in\ngrplist\n.  The effective group ID describes the group whose\nfile access permissions are used by the process (see\ngetegid(2)\n).  The\n-g\noption is often an alternative to\n--group\n.\np\npidlist\nSelect by process ID.  Identical to\n-p\nand\n--pid\n.\n-p\npidlist\nSelect by PID.

The BSD\nO\noption can act like\n-O\n(user-defined output format with some common fields\npredefined) or can be used to specify sort order.\nHeuristics are used to determine the behavior of this\noption.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained\n(sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other\nway (e.g., with\n-O\nor\n--sort\n).  When used as a formatting\noption, it is identical to\n-O\n, with the BSD personality.\n-O\nformat\nLike\n-o\n, but preloaded with some default columns.\nIdentical to\n-o pid,\nformat\n,state,tname,time,command\nor\n-o pid,\nformat\n,tname,time,cmd\n, see\n-o\nbelow.\no\nformat\nSpecify user-defined format.  Identical to\n-o\nand\n--format\n.\n-o\nformat\nUser-defined format.\nformat\nis a single argument in the\nform of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which\noffers a way to specify individual output columns.  The\nrecognized keywords are described in the\nSTANDARD FORMAT\nSPECIFIERS\nsection below.  Headers may be renamed (\nps -o\npid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command\n) as desired.  If all\ncolumn headers are empty (\nps -o pid= -o comm=\n) then the\nheader line will not be output.  Column width will increase\nas needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up\ncolumns such as WCHAN (\nps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o\ncomm\n).  Explicit width control (\nps opid,wchan:42,cmd\n) is\noffered too.  The behavior of\nps -o pid=X,comm=Y\nvaries\nwith personality; output may be one column named \"X,comm=Y\"\nor two columns named \"X\" and \"Y\".  Use multiple\n-o\noptions\nwhen in doubt.  Use the\nPS_FORMAT\nenvironment variable to\nspecify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros\nthat may be used to choose the default Unix or BSD columns.\n-P\nAdd a column showing\npsr\n.

This is derived from the name\nof the executable file, rather than from the argv value.\nCommand arguments and any modifications to them are thus\nnot shown.  This option effectively turns the\nargs\nformat\nkeyword into the\ncomm\nformat keyword; it is useful with the\n-f\nformat option and with the various BSD-style format\noptions, which all normally display the command arguments.\nSee the\n-f\noption, the format keyword\nargs\n, and the format\nkeyword\ncomm\n.\n--cols\nn\nSet screen width.\n--columns\nn\nSet screen width.\n--cumulative\nInclude some dead child process data (as a sum with the\nparent).\n-D\nformat\nSet the date format of the\nlstart\nfield to\nformat\n.

(or, one header per screen in the BSD\npersonality).  The\nh\noption is problematic.  Standard BSD\nps\nuses this option to print a header on each page of\noutput, but older Linux\nps\nuses this option to totally\ndisable the header.  This version of\nps\nfollows the Linux\nusage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality\nhas been selected, in which case it prints a header on each\npage of output.  Regardless of the current personality, you\ncan use the long options\n--headers\nand\n--no-headers\nto\nenable printing headers each page or disable headers\nentirely, respectively.\n-H\nShow process hierarchy (forest).\n--headers\nRepeat header lines, one per page of output.\nk\nspec\nSpecify sorting order.

The BSD\nO\noption can act like\n-O\n(user-defined output format with some common fields\npredefined) or can be used to specify sort order.\nHeuristics are used to determine the behavior of this\noption.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained\n(sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other\nway (e.g., with\n-O\nor\n--sort\n).\nFor sorting, obsolete BSD\nO\noption syntax is\nO\n[\n+\n|\n-\n]\nk1\n[,[\n+\n|\n-\n]\nk2\n[,...]].  It orders the processes listing\naccording to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence\nof one-letter short keys\nk1\n,\nk2\n, ... described in the\nOBSOLETE SORT KEYS\nsection below.  The \"+\" is currently\noptional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a\nkey, but may help to distinguish an\nO\nsort from an\nO\nformat.  The \"-\" reverses direction only on the key it\nprecedes.\n--rows\nn\nSet screen height.\nS\nSum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child\nprocesses into their parent.

This is not\nideal, and it does not conform to the standards that\nps\notherwise\nconforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.\nThe SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process\nincluding the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and\nstruct task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory\nthat is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process\n(code+data+stack).\nProcesses marked <defunct> are dead processes (so-called\n\"zombies\") that remain because their parent has not destroyed them\nproperly.  These processes will be destroyed by\ninit\n(8) if the\nparent process exits.\nIf the length of the username is greater than the width of the\ndisplay column, the username will be truncated.  See the\n-o\nand\n-O\nformatting options to customize length.\nCommands options such as\nps -aux\nare not recommended as it is a\nconfusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and\nUnix standards, the above command asks to display all processes\nwith a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all\nprocesses owned by a user named\nx\n.

It can display\nsystem\nsummary information as well as a\nlist of\nprocesses\nor\nthreads\ncurrently being managed by the Linux\nkernel.  The types of system summary information shown and the\ntypes, order and size of information displayed for processes are\nall user configurable and that configuration can be made\npersistent across restarts.\nThe program provides a limited interactive interface for process\nmanipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for\npersonal configuration  --  encompassing every aspect of its\noperation.  And while\ntop\nis referred to throughout this document,\nyou are free to name the program anything you wish.  That new\nname, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on top's display\nand used when reading and writing a configuration file.\nOVERVIEW\ntop\nDocumentation\nThe remaining Table of Contents\nOVERVIEW\nOperation\nLinux Memory Types\n1.

Alternatively, you could simply use\nthe traditional interrupt key (^C) when you're done.\nWhen started for the first time, you'll be presented with these\ntraditional elements on the main top screen: 1) Summary Area; 2)\nFields/Columns Header; 3) Task Area.  Each of these will be\nexplored in the sections that follow.  There is also an\nInput/Message line between the Summary Area and Columns Header\nwhich needs no further explanation.\nThe main top screen is\ngenerally\nquite adaptive to changes in\nterminal dimensions under X-Windows.  Other top screens may be\nless so, especially those with static text.  It ultimately\ndepends, however, on your particular window manager and terminal\nemulator.  There may be occasions when their view of terminal size\nand current contents differs from top's view, which is always\nbased on operating system calls.\nFollowing any re-size operation, if a top screen is corrupted,\nappears incomplete or disordered, simply typing something\ninnocuous like a punctuation character or cursor motion key will\nusually restore it.  In extreme cases, the following sequence\nalmost certainly will:\nkey/cmd\nobjective\n^Z\nsuspend\ntop\nfg\nresume\ntop\n<Left>   force a screen\nredraw\n(if necessary)\nBut if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you\ncould try.  Insert this command after top has been suspended but\nbefore resuming it.\nkey/cmd\nobjective\nreset    restore your\nterminal settings\nNote\n: the width of top's display will be limited to 512 positions.\nDisplaying all fields requires approximately 250 characters.\nRemaining screen width is usually allocated to any variable width\ncolumns currently visible.  The variable width columns, such as\nCOMMAND, are noted in topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields.  Actual\noutput width may also be influenced by the -w switch, which is\ndiscussed in topic 1. COMMAND-LINE Options.\nLastly, some of top's screens or functions require the use of\ncursor motion keys like the standard arrow keys plus the Home,\nEnd, PgUp and PgDn keys.  If your terminal or emulator does not\nprovide those keys, the following combinations are accepted as\nalternatives:\nkey\nequivalent-keys\nLeft     alt +\nh\nDown     alt +\nj\nUp       alt +\nk\nRight    alt +\nl\nHome     alt + ctrl +\nh\nPgDn     alt + ctrl +\nj\nPgUp     alt + ctrl +\nk\nEnd      alt + ctrl +\nl\nThe\nUp\nand\nDown\narrow keys have special significance when prompted\nfor line input terminated with the <Enter> key.  Those keys, or\ntheir aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines which\ncan then be edited and re-input.  And there are four additional\nkeys available with line oriented input.\nkey\nspecial-significance\nUp       recall\nolder\nstrings for re-editing\nDown     recall\nnewer\nstrings or\nerase\nentire line\nInsert   toggle between\ninsert\nand\novertype\nmodes\nDelete   character\nremoved\nat cursor, moving others left\nHome     jump to\nbeginning\nof input line\nEnd      jump to\nend\nof input line\nLinux Memory Types\nFor our purposes there are three types of memory, and one is\noptional.  First is physical memory, a limited resource where code\nand data must reside when executed or referenced.  Next is the\noptional swap file, where modified (dirty) memory can be saved and\nlater retrieved if too many demands are made on physical memory.\nLastly we have virtual memory, a nearly unlimited resource serving\nthe following goals:\n1. abstraction, free from physical memory addresses/limits\n2. isolation, every process in a separate address space\n3. sharing, a single mapping can serve multiple needs\n4. flexibility, assign a virtual address to a file\nRegardless of which of these forms memory may take, all are\nmanaged as pages (typically 4096 bytes) but expressed by default\nin top as KiB (kibibyte).  The memory discussed under topic â2c.\nMEMORY Usageâ deals with physical memory and the swap file for the\nsystem as a whole.  The memory reviewed in topic â3. FIELDS /\nColumns Displayâ embraces all three memory types, but for\nindividual processes.\nFor each such process, every memory page is restricted to a single\nquadrant from the table below.  Both physical memory and virtual\nmemory can include any of the four, while the swap file only\nincludes #1 through #3.  The memory in quadrant #4, when modified,\nacts as its own dedicated swap file.\nPrivate\n|\nShared\n1\n|\n2\nAnonymous\n. stack               |\n. malloc()            |\n. brk()/sbrk()        | . POSIX shm*\n. mmap(PRIVATE, ANON) | . mmap(SHARED, ANON)\n-----------------------+----------------------\n. mmap(PRIVATE, fd)   | . mmap(SHARED, fd)\nFile-backed\n. pgms/shared libs    |\n3\n|\n4\nThe following may help in interpreting process level memory values\ndisplayed as scalable columns and discussed under topic â3a.\nDESCRIPTIONS of Fieldsâ.\n%MEM - simply RES divided by total physical memory\nCODE - the âpgmsâ portion of quadrant\n3\nDATA - the entire quadrant\n1\nportion of VIRT plus all\nexplicit mmap file-backed pages of quadrant\n3\nRES  - anything occupying physical memory which, beginning with\nLinux-4.5, is the sum of the following three fields:\nRSan - quadrant\n1\npages, which include any\nformer quadrant\n3\npages if modified\nRSfd - quadrant\n3\nand quadrant\n4\npages\nRSsh - quadrant\n2\npages\nRSlk - subset of RES which cannot be swapped out (any quadrant)\nSHR  - subset of RES (excludes\n1\n, includes all\n2\n&\n4\n, some\n3\n)\nSWAP - potentially any quadrant except\n4\nUSED - simply the sum of RES and SWAP\nVIRT - everything in-use and/or reserved (all quadrants)\nNote\n: Even though program images and shared libraries are\nconsidered\nprivate\nto a process, they will be accounted for as\nshared\n(SHR) by the kernel.\n1. COMMAND-LINE Options\ntop\nMandatory\narguments\nto long options are mandatory for short\noptions too.\nAlthough not required, the equals sign can be used with either\noption form and whitespace before and/or after the â=â is\npermitted.\n-\nA\n,\n--apply-defaults\nRun top with build defaults only, ignoring all configuration\nfiles except /etc/toprc.  This option, when specified, must be\nthe only command line option present.\n-\nb\n,\n--batch\nStarts top in Batch mode, which could be useful for sending\noutput from top to other programs or to a file.  In this mode,\ntop will not accept input and runs until the iterations limit\nyou've set with the â-nâ command-line option or until killed.\n-\nc\n,\n--cmdline-toggle\nStarts top with the last remembered âcâ state reversed.  Thus,\nif top was displaying command lines, now that field will show\nprogram names, and vice versa.  See the âcâ interactive command\nfor additional information.\n-\nd\n,\n--delay\n=\nSECS\n[\n.TENTHS\n]\nSpecifies the delay between screen updates, and overrides the\ncorresponding value in one's personal configuration file or the\nstartup default.  Later this can be changed with the âdâ or âsâ\ninteractive commands.\nFractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not\nallowed.  In all cases, however, such changes are prohibited if\ntop is running in Secure mode, except for root (unless the âsâ\ncommand-line option was used).  For additional information on\nSecure mode see topic 6d. SYSTEM Restrictions File.\n-\nE\n,\n--scale-summary-mem\n=\nk\n|\nm\n|\ng\n|\nt\n|\np\n|\ne\nInstructs top to force summary area memory to be scaled as:\nk - kibibytes\nm - mebibytes\ng - gibibytes\nt - tebibytes\np - pebibytes\ne - exbibytes\nLater this can be changed with the âEâ command toggle.\n-\ne\n,\n--scale-task-mem\n=\nk\n|\nm\n|\ng\n|\nt\n|\np\nInstructs top to force task area memory to be scaled as:\nk - kibibytes\nm - mebibytes\ng - gibibytes\nt - tebibytes\np - pebibytes\nLater this can be changed with the âeâ command toggle.\n-\nH\n,\n--threads-show\nInstructs top to display individual threads.  Without this\ncommand-line option a summation of all threads in each process\nis shown.  Later this can be changed with the âHâ interactive\ncommand.\n-\nh\n,\n--help\nDisplay usage help text, then quit.\n-\ni\n,\n--idle-toggle\nStarts top with the last remembered âiâ state reversed.  When\nthis toggle is\nOff\n, tasks that have not used any CPU since the\nlast update will not be displayed.  For additional information\nregarding this toggle see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SIZE.\n-\nn\n,\n--iterations\n=\nNUMBER\nSpecifies the maximum number of iterations, or frames, top\nshould produce before ending.\n-\nO\n,\n--list-fields\nThis option acts as a form of help for the -o option shown\nbelow.  It will cause top to print each of the available field\nnames on a separate line, then quit.  Such names are subject to\nNLS (National Language Support) translation.\n-\no\n,\n--sort-override\n=\nFIELDNAME\nSpecifies the name of the field on which tasks will be sorted,\nindependent of what is reflected in the configuration file.\nYou can prepend a â+â or â-â to the field name to also override\nthe sort direction.  A leading â+â will force sorting high to\nlow, whereas a â-â will ensure a low to high ordering.\nThis option exists primarily to support automated/scripted\nbatch mode operation.\n-\np\n,\n--pid\n=\nPIDLIST\n(as:\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n, ... or\n-p\n1\n-p\n2\n-p\n3\n...)  Monitor only processes with specified process\nIDs.  However, when combined with Threads mode (âHâ), all\nprocesses in the thread group (see TGID) of each monitored PID\nwill also be shown.\nThis option can be given up to 20 times, or you can provide a\ncomma delimited list with up to 20 pids.  Co-mingling both\napproaches is permitted.\nA pid value of zero will be treated as the process id of the\ntop program itself once it is running.\nThis is a command-line option only and should you wish to\nreturn to normal operation, it is not necessary to quit and\nrestart top  --  just issue any of these interactive commands:\nâ=â, âuâ or âUâ.\nThe âpâ, âuâ and âUâ command-line options are mutually\nexclusive.\n-\nS\n,\n--accum-time-toggle\nStarts top with the last remembered âSâ state reversed.  When\nCumulative time mode is\nOn\n, each process is listed with the cpu\ntime that it and its dead children have used.  See the âSâ\ninteractive command for additional information regarding this\nmode.\n-\ns\n,\n--secure-mode\nStarts top with secure mode forced, even for root.  This mode\nis far better controlled through a system configuration file\n(see topic 6. FILES).\n-\nU\n,\n--filter-any-user\n=\nUSER\n(as:\nnumber\nor\nname\n)\nDisplay only processes with a user id or user name matching\nthat given.  This option matches on\nany\nuser (\nreal\n,\neffective\n,\nsaved\n, or\nfilesystem\n).\nPrepending an exclamation point (â!â) to the user id or name\ninstructs top to display only processes with users not matching\nthe one provided.\nThe âpâ, âUâ and âuâ command-line options are mutually\nexclusive.\n-\nu\n,\n--filter-only-euser\n=\nUSER\n(as:\nnumber\nor\nname\n)\nDisplay only processes with a user id or user name matching\nthat given.  This option matches on the\neffective\nuser id only.\nPrepending an exclamation point (â!â) to the user id or name\ninstructs top to display only processes with users not matching\nthe one provided.\nThe âpâ, âUâ and âuâ command-line options are mutually\nexclusive.\n-\nV\n,\n--version\nDisplay version information, then quit.\n-\nw\n,\n--width\n[=\nCOLUMNS\n]\nIn Batch mode, when used without an argument top will format\noutput using the COLUMNS= and LINES= environment variables, if\nset.  Otherwise, width will be fixed at the maximum 512\ncolumns.  With an argument, output width can be decreased or\nincreased (up to 512) but the number of rows is considered\nunlimited.\nIn normal display mode, when used without an argument top will\nattempt\nto format output using the COLUMNS= and LINES=\nenvironment variables, if set.  With an argument, output width\ncan only be decreased, not increased.  Whether using\nenvironment variables or an argument with -w, when\nnot\nin Batch\nmode actual terminal dimensions can never be exceeded.\nNote\n: Without the use of this command-line option, output width\nis always based on the terminal at which top was invoked\nwhether or not in Batch mode.\n-\n1\n,\n--single-cpu-toggle\nStarts top with the last remembered Cpu States portion of the\nsummary area reversed.  Either all cpu information will be\ndisplayed in a single line or each cpu will be displayed\nseparately, depending on the state of the NUMA Node command\ntoggle (â2â).\nSee the â1â and â2â interactive commands for additional\ninformation.\n2. SUMMARY Display\ntop\nEach of the following three areas are individually controlled\nthrough one or more interactive commands.  See topic 4b. SUMMARY\nAREA Commands for additional information regarding these\nprovisions.\n2a. UPTIME and LOAD Averages\nThis portion consists of a single line containing:\nprogram\nor\nwindow\nname, depending on display mode\ncurrent time and length of time since last boot\ntotal number of users\nsystem load avg over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes\n2b. TASK and CPU States\nThis portion consists of a minimum of two lines.  In an SMP\nenvironment, additional lines can reflect individual CPU state\npercentages.\nLine 1 shows total\ntasks\nor\nthreads\n, depending on the state of the\nThreads-mode toggle.  That total is further classified according\nto task state as follows:\ndisplayed       process status (âSâ)\n---------       --------------------\nrunning         R\nsleep           S + any remaining\nd-sleep         D\nstopped         T + t\nzombie          Z\nLine 2 shows CPU state percentages based on the interval since the\nlast refresh.\nAs a default, percentages for these individual categories are\ndisplayed.  Depending on your kernel version, the\nst\nfield may not\nbe shown.\nus\n: time running un-niced user processes\nsy\n: time running kernel processes\nni\n: time running niced user processes\nid\n: time spent in the kernel idle handler\nwa\n: time waiting for I/O completion\nhi\n: time spent servicing hardware interrupts\nsi\n: time spent servicing software interrupts\nst\n: time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor\nBeyond the first tasks/threads line, there are alternate CPU\ndisplay modes available via the 4-way âtâ command toggle.  They\nshow an abbreviated summary consisting of these elements:\na    b     c    d\n%Cpu(s):\n75.0\n/25.0\n100\n[ ... ]\nWhere: a) is the âuserâ (us + ni) percentage; b) is the âsystemâ\n(sy + hi + si + guests) percentage; c) is the total percentage;\nand d) is one of two visual graphs of those representations.  Such\ngraphs also reflect separate âuserâ and âsystemâ portions.\nIf the â4â command toggle is used to yield more than two cpus per\nline, results will be further abridged eliminating the a) and b)\nelements.  However, that information is still reflected in the\ngraph itself assuming color is active or, if not, bars vs. blocks\nare being shown.\nSee topic 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands for additional information on\nthe âtâ and â4â command toggles.\n2c. MEMORY Usage\nThis portion consists of two lines which may express values in\nkibibytes (KiB) through exbibytes (EiB) depending on the scaling\nfactor enforced with the âEâ interactive command. The\n/proc/meminfo source fields are shown in parenthesis.\nLine 1 reflects physical memory, classified as:\ntotal          ( MemTotal )\nfree           ( MemFree )\nused           ( MemTotal - MemAvailable )\nbuff/cache     ( Buffers + Cached + SReclaimable )\nLine 2 reflects mostly virtual memory, classified as:\ntotal          ( SwapTotal )\nfree           ( SwapFree )\nused           ( SwapTotal - SwapFree )\navail          ( MemAvailable, which is physical memory )\nThe\navail\nnumber on line 2 is an estimation of physical memory\navailable for starting new applications, without swapping.  Unlike\nthe\nfree\nfield, it attempts to account for readily reclaimable\npage cache and memory slabs.  It is available on kernels 3.14,\nemulated on kernels 2.6.27+, otherwise the same as\nfree\n.\nIn the alternate memory display modes, two abbreviated summary\nlines are shown consisting of these elements:\na    b          c\nGiB Mem :\n18.7\n/15.738   [ ... ]\nGiB Swap:\n0.0\n/7.999    [ ... ]\nWhere: a) is the percentage used; b) is the total available; and\nc) is one of two visual graphs of those representations.\nIn the case of physical memory, the percentage represents the\ntotal\nminus the estimated\navail\nnoted above.  The âMemâ graph\nitself is divided between the non-cached portion of\nused\nand any\nremaining memory not otherwise accounted for by\navail\n.  See topic\n4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands and the âmâ command for additional\ninformation on that special 4-way toggle.\nThis table may help in interpreting the scaled values displayed:\nKiB = kibibyte = 1024 bytes\nMiB = mebibyte = 1024 KiB = 1,048,576 bytes\nGiB = gibibyte = 1024 MiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes\nTiB = tebibyte = 1024 GiB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes\nPiB = pebibyte = 1024 TiB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes\nEiB = exbibyte = 1024 PiB = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes\n3. FIELDS / Columns\ntop\n3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields\nListed below are top's available process fields (columns).  They\nare shown in strict ascii alphabetical order.  You may customize\ntheir position and whether or not they are displayable with the\nâfâ (Fields Management) interactive command.\nAny field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether\nthey are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high.  For additional\ninformation on sort provisions see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands,\nSORTING.\nThe fields related to physical memory or virtual memory reference\nâ(KiB)â which is the unsuffixed display mode.  Such fields may,\nhowever, be scaled from KiB through PiB.  That scaling is\ninfluenced via the âeâ interactive command or established for\nstartup through a build option.\n%CPU\n--  CPU Usage\nThe task's share of the elapsed CPU time since the last screen\nupdate, expressed as a percentage of total CPU time.\nIn a true SMP environment, if a process is multi-threaded and\ntop is\nnot\noperating in Threads mode, amounts greater than\n100% may be reported.  You toggle Threads mode with the âHâ\ninteractive command.\nAlso for multi-processor environments, if Irix mode is\nOff\n,\ntop will operate in Solaris mode where a task's cpu usage will\nbe divided by the total number of CPUs.  You toggle\nIrix/Solaris modes with the âIâ interactive command.\nNote\n: When running in forest view mode (âVâ) with children\ncollapsed (âvâ), this field will also include the CPU time of\nthose unseen children.  See topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands,\nCONTENT for more information regarding the âVâ and âvâ\ntoggles.\n%CUC\n--  CPU Utilization\nThis field is identical to %CUU below, except the percentage\nalso reflects reaped child processes.\n%CUU\n--  CPU Utilization\nA task's total CPU usage divided by its elapsed running time,\nexpressed as a percentage.\nIf a process currently displays high CPU usage, this field can\nhelp determine if such behavior is normal.  Conversely, if a\nprocess has low CPU usage currently, %CUU may reflect\nhistorically higher demands over its lifetime.\n%MEM\n--  Memory Usage (RES)\nA task's currently resident share of available physical\nmemory.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nAGID\n--  Autogroup Identifier\nThe autogroup identifier associated with a process.  This\nfeature operates in conjunction with the CFS scheduler to\nimprove interactive desktop performance.\nWhen /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled is set, a new\nautogroup is created with each new session (see SID).  All\nsubsequently forked processes in that session inherit\nmembership in this autogroup.  The kernel then attempts to\nequalize distribution of CPU cycles across such groups.  Thus,\nan autogroup with many CPU intensive processes (e.g make -j)\nwill not dominate an autogroup with only one or two processes.\nWhen -1 is displayed it means this information is not\navailable.\nAGNI\n--  Autogroup Nice Value\nThe autogroup nice value which affects scheduling of all\nprocesses in that group.  A negative nice value means higher\npriority, whereas a positive nice value means lower priority.\nCGNAME\n--  Control Group Name\nThe name of the control group to which a process belongs, or\nâ-â if not applicable for that process.\nAvailable with cgroup v1 only, this will typically be the last\nentry in the full list of control groups as displayed under\nthe CGROUPS heading.  And as is true there, this field is also\nvariable width.\nCGROUPS\n--  Control Groups\nThe names of the control group(s) to which a process belongs,\nor â-â if not applicable for that process.\nControl Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory,\nnetwork bandwidth, etc.) among installation-defined groups of\nprocesses.  They enable fine-grained control over allocating,\ndenying, prioritizing, managing and monitoring those\nresources.\nMany different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously\non a system and each hierarchy is attached to one or more\nsubsystems.  A subsystem represents a single resource.\nNote\n: The CGROUPS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-\nwidth.  When displayed, it plus any other variable width\ncolumns will be allocated all remaining screen width (up to\nthe maximum 512 characters).  Even so, such variable width\nfields could still suffer truncation.  See topic 5c. SCROLLING\na Window for additional information on accessing any truncated\ndata.\nCLS\n--  Scheduling Class\nThe task's current scheduling policy which can be one of:\n-\n= not reported\nTS\n= SCHED_OTHER\nFF\n= SCHED_FIFO\nRR\n= SCHED_RR\nB\n= SCHED_BATCH\nISO\n= SCHED_ISO\nIDL\n= SCHED_IDLE\nDLN\n= SCHED_DEADLINE\n?\n= unknown value\nCODE\n--  Code Size (KiB)\nThe amount of physical memory currently devoted to executable\ncode, also known as the Text Resident Set size or TRS.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nCOMMAND\n--  Command\nName\nor Command\nLine\nDisplay the command line used to start a task or the name of\nthe associated program.  You toggle between command\nline\nand\nname\nwith âcâ, which is both a command-line option and an\ninteractive command.\nWhen you've chosen to display command lines, processes without\na command line (like kernel threads) will be shown with only\nthe program name in brackets, as in this example:\n[kthreadd]\nThis field may also be impacted by the forest view display\nmode.  See the âVâ interactive command for additional\ninformation regarding that mode.\nNote\n: The COMMAND field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-\nwidth.  When displayed, it plus any other variable width\ncolumns will be allocated all remaining screen width (up to\nthe maximum 512 characters).  Even so, such variable width\nfields could still suffer truncation.  This is especially true\nfor this field when command lines are being displayed (the âcâ\ninteractive command.)  See topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for\nadditional information on accessing any truncated data.\nDATA\n--  Data + Stack Size (KiB)\nThe amount of private memory\nreserved\nby a process.  It is\nalso known as the Data Resident Set or DRS.  Such memory may\nnot yet be mapped to physical memory (RES) but will always be\nincluded in the virtual memory (VIRT) amount.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nDocker\n--  Docker Container ID\nThe identity (abbreviated hash) of the docker container within\nwhich a task is running.  If a process is not running inside a\ncontainer, a dash (â-â) will be shown.\nELAPSED\n--  Elapsed Running Time\nThe length of time since a process was started.  Thus, the\nmost recently started task will display the smallest time\ninterval.\nThe value will be expressed as âHH,MMâ (hours,minutes) but is\nsubject to additional scaling if the interval becomes too\ngreat to fit column width.  At that point it will be scaled to\nâDD+HHâ (days+hours) and possibly beyond.\nENVIRON\n--  Environment variables\nDisplay all of the environment variables, if any, as seen by\nthe respective processes.  These variables will be displayed\nin their raw native order, not the sorted order you are\naccustomed to seeing with an unqualified âsetâ.\nNote\n: The ENVIRON field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-\nwidth.  When displayed, it plus any other variable width\ncolumns will be allocated all remaining screen width (up to\nthe maximum 512 characters).  Even so, such variable width\nfields could still suffer truncation.  This is especially true\nfor this field.  See topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for\nadditional information on accessing any truncated data.\nEXE\n--  Executable Path\nWhere available, this is the full path to the executable,\nincluding the program name.\nNote\n: The EXE field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.\nWhen displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will\nbe allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512\ncharacters).\nFlags\n--  Task Flags\nThis column represents the task's current scheduling flags\nwhich are expressed in hexadecimal notation and with zeros\nsuppressed.  These flags are officially documented in\n<linux/sched.h>.\nGID\n--  Group Id\nThe\neffective\ngroup ID.\nGROUP\n--  Group Name\nThe\neffective\ngroup name.\nLOGID\n--  Login User Id\nThe user ID used at\nlogin\n.  When -1 is displayed it means this\ninformation is not available.\nLXC\n--  Lxc Container Name\nThe name of the lxc container within which a task is running.\nIf a process is not running inside a container, a dash (â-â)\nwill be shown.\nNI\n--  Nice Value\nThe nice value of the task.  A negative nice value means\nhigher priority, whereas a positive nice value means lower\npriority.  Zero in this field simply means priority will not\nbe adjusted in determining a task's dispatch-ability.\nNote\n: This value only affects scheduling priority relative to\nother processes in the same autogroup.  See the âAGIDâ and\nâAGNIâ fields for additional information on autogroups.\nNU\n--  Last known NUMA node\nA number representing the NUMA node associated with the last\nused processor (âPâ).  When -1 is displayed it means that NUMA\ninformation is not available.\nSee the â2â and â3â interactive commands for additional NUMA\nprovisions affecting the summary area.\nOOMa\n--  Out of Memory Adjustment Factor\nThe value, ranging from -1000 to +1000, added to the current\nout of memory score (OOMs) which is then used to determine\nwhich task to kill when memory is exhausted.\nOOMs\n--  Out of Memory Score\nThe value, ranging from 0 to +1000, used to select task(s) to\nkill when memory is exhausted.  Zero translates to ânever\nkillâ whereas 1000 means âalways killâ.\nP\n--  Last used CPU (SMP)\nA number representing the last used processor.  In a true SMP\nenvironment this will likely change frequently since the\nkernel intentionally uses weak affinity.  Also, the very act\nof running top may break this weak affinity and cause more\nprocesses to change CPUs more often (because of the extra\ndemand for cpu time).\nPGRP\n--  Process Group Id\nEvery process is member of a unique process group which is\nused for distribution of signals and by terminals to arbitrate\nrequests for their input and output.  When a process is\ncreated (forked), it becomes a member of the process group of\nits parent.  By convention, this value equals the process ID\n(see PID) of the first member of a process group, called the\nprocess group leader.\nPID\n--  Process Id\nThe task's unique process ID, which periodically wraps, though\nnever restarting at zero.  In kernel terms, it is a\ndispatchable entity defined by a task_struct.\nThis value may also be used as: a process group ID (see PGRP);\na session ID for the session leader (see SID); a thread group\nID for the thread group leader (see TGID); and a TTY process\ngroup ID for the process group leader (see TPGID).\nPPID\n--  Parent Process Id\nThe process ID (pid) of a task's parent.\nPR\n--  Priority\nThe scheduling priority of the task.  If you see ârtâ in this\nfield, it means the task is running under real time scheduling\npriority.\nUnder linux, real time priority is somewhat misleading since\ntraditionally the operating itself was not preemptible.  And\nwhile the 2.6 kernel can be made mostly preemptible, it is not\nalways so.\nPSS\n--  Proportional Resident Memory, smaps (KiB)\nThe proportion of this task's share of âRSSâ where each page\nis divided by the number of processes sharing it.  It is also\nthe sum of the âPSanâ, âPSfdâ and âPSshâ fields.\nFor example, if a process has 1000 resident pages alone and\n1000 resident pages shared with another process, its âPSSâ\nwould be 1500 (times page size).\nAccessing smaps values is 10x more costly than other memory\nstatistics and data for other users requires root privileges.\nPSan\n--  Proportional Anonymous Memory, smaps (KiB)\nPSfd\n--  Proportional File Memory, smaps (KiB)\nPSsh\n--  Proportional Shmem Memory, smaps (KiB)\nAs was true for âPSSâ above (total proportional resident\nmemory), these fields represent the proportion of this task's\nshare of each type of memory divided by the number of\nprocesses sharing it.\nAccessing smaps values is 10x more costly than other memory\nstatistics and data for other users requires root privileges.\nRES\n--  Resident Memory Size (KiB)\nA subset of the virtual address space (VIRT) representing the\nnon-swapped physical memory a task is currently using.  It is\nalso the sum of the âRSanâ, âRSfdâ and âRSshâ fields.\nIt can include private anonymous pages, private pages mapped\nto files (including program images and shared libraries) plus\nshared anonymous pages.  All such memory is backed by the swap\nfile represented separately under SWAP.\nLastly, this field may also include shared file-backed pages\nwhich, when modified, act as a dedicated swap file and thus\nwill never impact SWAP.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nRSS\n--  Resident Memory, smaps (KiB)\nAnother, more precise view of process non-swapped physical\nmemory.  It is obtained from the âsmaps_rollupâ file and is\ngenerally slightly larger than that shown for âRESâ.\nAccessing smaps values is 10x more costly than other memory\nstatistics and data for other users requires root privileges.\nRSan\n--  Resident Anonymous Memory Size (KiB)\nA subset of resident memory (RES) representing private pages\nnot mapped to a file.\nRSfd\n--  Resident File-Backed Memory Size (KiB)\nA subset of resident memory (RES) representing the implicitly\nshared pages supporting program images and shared libraries.\nIt also includes explicit file mappings, both private and\nshared.\nRSlk\n--  Resident Locked Memory Size (KiB)\nA subset of resident memory (RES) which cannot be swapped out.\nRSsh\n--  Resident Shared Memory Size (KiB)\nA subset of resident memory (RES) representing the explicitly\nshared anonymous shm*/mmap pages.\nRUID\n--  Real User Id\nThe\nreal\nuser ID.\nRUSER\n--  Real User Name\nThe\nreal\nuser name.\nS\n--  Process Status\nThe status of the task which can be one of:\nD\n= uninterruptible sleep\nI\n= idle\nR\n= running\nS\n= sleeping\nT\n= stopped by job control signal\nt\n= stopped by debugger during trace\nZ\n= zombie\nTasks shown as running should be more properly thought of as\nready to run  --  their task_struct is simply represented on\nthe Linux run-queue.  Even without a true SMP machine, you may\nsee numerous tasks in this state depending on top's delay\ninterval and nice value.\nSHR\n--  Shared Memory Size (KiB)\nA subset of resident memory (RES) that may be used by other\nprocesses.  It will include shared anonymous pages and shared\nfile-backed pages.  It also includes private pages mapped to\nfiles representing program images and shared libraries.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nSID\n--  Session Id\nA session is a collection of process groups (see PGRP),\nusually established by the login shell.  A newly forked\nprocess joins the session of its creator.  By convention, this\nvalue equals the process ID (see PID) of the first member of\nthe session, called the session leader, which is usually the\nlogin shell.\nSTARTED\n--  Start Time Interval\nThe length of time since system boot when a process started.\nThus, the most recently started task will display the largest\ntime interval.\nThe value will be expressed as âMM:SSâ (minutes:seconds).  But\nif the interval is too great to fit column width it will be\nscaled as âHH,MMâ (hours,minutes) and possibly beyond.\nSUID\n--  Saved User Id\nThe\nsaved\nuser ID.\nSUPGIDS\n--  Supplementary Group IDs\nThe IDs of any supplementary group(s) established at login or\ninherited from a task's parent.  They are displayed in a comma\ndelimited list.\nNote\n: The SUPGIDS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-\nwidth.  When displayed, it plus any other variable width\ncolumns will be allocated all remaining screen width (up to\nthe maximum 512 characters).\nSUPGRPS\n--  Supplementary Group Names\nThe names of any supplementary group(s) established at login\nor inherited from a task's parent.  They are displayed in a\ncomma delimited list.\nNote\n: The SUPGRPS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-\nwidth.  When displayed, it plus any other variable width\ncolumns will be allocated all remaining screen width (up to\nthe maximum 512 characters).\nSUSER\n--  Saved User Name\nThe\nsaved\nuser name.\nSWAP\n--  Swapped Size (KiB)\nThe formerly resident portion of a task's address space\nwritten to the swap file when physical memory becomes over\ncommitted.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nTGID\n--  Thread Group Id\nThe ID of the thread group to which a task belongs.  It is the\nPID of the thread group leader.  In kernel terms, it\nrepresents those tasks that share an mm_struct.\nTIME\n--  CPU Time\nTotal CPU time the task has used since it started.  When\nCumulative mode is\nOn\n, each process is listed with the cpu\ntime that it and its dead children have used.  You toggle\nCumulative mode with âSâ, which is both a command-line option\nand an interactive command.  See the âSâ interactive command\nfor additional information regarding this mode.\nTIME+\n--  CPU Time, hundredths\nThe same as TIME, but reflecting more granularity through\nhundredths of a second.\nTPGID\n--  Tty Process Group Id\nThe process group ID of the foreground process for the\nconnected tty, or -1 if a process is not connected to a\nterminal.  By convention, this value equals the process ID\n(see PID) of the process group leader (see PGRP).\nTTY\n--  Controlling Tty\nThe name of the controlling terminal.  This is usually the\ndevice (serial port, pty, etc.) from which the process was\nstarted, and which it uses for input or output.  However, a\ntask need not be associated with a terminal, in which case\nyou'll see â?â displayed.\nUID\n--  User Id\nThe\neffective\nuser ID of the task's owner.\nUSED\n--  Memory in Use (KiB)\nThis field represents the non-swapped physical memory a task\nis using (RES) plus the swapped out portion of its address\nspace (SWAP).\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nUSER\n--  User Name\nThe\neffective\nuser name of the task's owner.\nUSS\n--  Unique Set Size\nThe non-swapped portion of physical memory (âRSSâ) not shared\nwith any other process.  It is derived from the âsmaps_rollupâ\nfile.\nAccessing smaps values is 10x more costly than other memory\nstatistics and data for other users requires root privileges.\nVIRT\n--  Virtual Memory Size (KiB)\nThe total amount of virtual memory used by the task.  It\nincludes all code, data and shared libraries plus pages that\nhave been swapped out and pages that have been mapped but not\nused.\nSee âOVERVIEW, Linux Memory Typesâ for additional details.\nWCHAN\n--  Sleeping in Function\nThis field will show the name of the kernel function in which\nthe task is currently sleeping.  Running tasks will display a\ndash (â-â) in this column.\nioR\n--  I/O Bytes Read\nThe number of bytes a process caused to be fetched from the\nstorage layer.\nRoot privileges are required to display âioâ data for other\nusers.\nioRop\n--  I/O Read Operations\nThe number of read I/O operations (syscalls) for a process.\nSuch calls might not result in actual physical disk I/O.\nioW\n--  I/O Bytes Written\nThe number of bytes a process caused to be sent to the storage\nlayer.\nioWop\n--  I/O Write Operations\nThe number of write I/O operations (syscalls) for a process.\nSuch calls might not result in actual physical disk I/O.\nnDRT\n--  Dirty Pages Count\nThe number of pages that have been modified since they were\nlast written to auxiliary storage.  Dirty pages must be\nwritten to auxiliary storage before the corresponding physical\nmemory location can be used for some other virtual page.\nThis field was deprecated with linux 2.6 and is always zero.\nnFD\n--  Number of File Descriptors\nThe total number of open files associated with a process.\nnMaj\n--  Major Page Fault Count\nThe number of\nmajor\npage faults that have occurred for a task.\nA page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or\nwrite to a virtual page that is not currently present in its\naddress space.  A major page fault is when auxiliary storage\naccess is involved in making that page available.\nnMin\n--  Minor Page Fault count\nThe number of\nminor\npage faults that have occurred for a task.\nA page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or\nwrite to a virtual page that is not currently present in its\naddress space.  A minor page fault does not involve auxiliary\nstorage access in making that page available.\nnTH\n--  Number of Threads\nThe number of threads associated with a process.\nnsCGROUP\n--  CGROUP namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to hide the identity of the\ncontrol group of which process is a member.\nnsIPC\n--  IPC namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to isolate interprocess\ncommunication (IPC) resources such as System V IPC objects and\nPOSIX message queues.\nnsMNT\n--  MNT namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to isolate filesystem mount\npoints thus offering different views of the filesystem\nhierarchy.\nnsNET\n--  NET namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to isolate resources such as\nnetwork devices, IP addresses, IP routing, port numbers, etc.\nnsPID\n--  PID namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to isolate process ID numbers\nmeaning they need not remain unique.  Thus, each such\nnamespace could have its own âinit/systemdâ (PID #1) to manage\nvarious initialization tasks and reap orphaned child\nprocesses.\nnsTIME\n--  TIME namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace which allows processes to see\ndifferent system times in a way similar to the UTS namespace.\nnsUSER\n--  USER namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to isolate the user and group\nID numbers.  Thus, a process could have a normal unprivileged\nuser ID outside a user namespace while having a user ID of 0,\nwith full root privileges, inside that namespace.\nnsUTS\n--  UTS namespace\nThe Inode of the namespace used to isolate hostname and NIS\ndomain name.  UTS simply means \"Unix Time-sharing System\".\nvMj\n--  Major Page Fault Count Delta\nThe number of\nmajor\npage faults that have occurred since the\nlast update (see nMaj).\nvMn\n--  Minor Page Fault Count Delta\nThe number of\nminor\npage faults that have occurred since the\nlast update (see nMin).\n3b. MANAGING Fields\nAfter pressing the interactive command âfâ (Fields Management) you\nwill be presented with a screen showing: 1) the âcurrentâ window\nname; 2) the designated sort field; 3) all fields in their current\norder along with descriptions.  Entries marked with an asterisk\nare the currently displayed fields, screen width permitting.\nâ¢  As the on screen instructions indicate, you navigate among\nthe fields with the\nUp\nand\nDown\narrow keys.  The PgUp,\nPgDn, Home and End keys can also be used to quickly reach\nthe first or last available field.\nâ¢  The\nRight\narrow key selects a field for repositioning and\nthe\nLeft\narrow key or the <\nEnter\n> key commits that field's\nplacement.\nâ¢  The â\nd\nâ key or the <\nSpace\n> bar toggles a field's display\nstatus, and thus the presence or absence of the asterisk.\nâ¢  The â\ns\nâ key designates a field as the sort field.  See\ntopic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING for additional\ninformation regarding your selection of a sort field.\nâ¢  The â\na\nâ and â\nw\nâ keys can be used to cycle through all\navailable windows and the â\nq\nâ or <\nEsc\n> keys exit Fields\nManagement.\nThe Fields Management screen can also be used to change the\nâcurrentâ window/field group in either full-screen mode or\nalternate-display mode.  Whatever was targeted when âqâ or <Esc>\nwas pressed will be made current as you return to the top display.\nSee topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the âgâ interactive\ncommand for insight into âcurrentâ windows and field groups.\nNote\n: Any window that has been scrolled\nhorizontally\nwill be reset\nif any field changes are made via the Fields Management screen.\nAny\nvertical\nscrolled position, however, will not be affected.\nSee topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information\nregarding vertical and horizontal scrolling.\n4. INTERACTIVE Commands\ntop\nListed below is a brief index of commands within categories.  Some\ncommands appear more than once  --  their meaning or scope may\nvary depending on the context in which they are issued.\n4a.\nGlobal-Commands\n<Ent/Sp> ?, =, 0,\nA, B, d, E, e, g, H, h, I, k, q, r, s, W, X, Y, Z,\n^E, ^R\n4b.\nSummary-Area-Commands\nC, l, t, m, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, !\n4c.\nTask-Area-Commands\nAppearance:  b, J, j, x, y, z\nContent:     c, F, f, O, o, S, U, u, V, v\nSize:        #, i, n\nSorting:     <, >, f, R\n4d.\nBottom-Window-Commands\n^A, ^G, ^K, ^L, ^N, ^P, ^U, Tab, Shift+Tab\n4e.\nColor-Mapping\n<Ret>, a, B, b, H, M, q, S, T, w, z, @, 0 - 7\n5b.\nCommands-for-Windows\n-, _, =, +, A, a, G, g, w\n5c.\nScrolling-a-Window\nC, Up, Dn, Left, Right, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End\n5d.\nSearching-in-a-Window\nL, &\n5e.\nFiltering-in-a-Window\nO, o, ^O, =, +\n4a. GLOBAL Commands\nThe global interactive commands are\nalways\navailable in both\nfull-screen mode and alternate-display mode.  However, some of\nthese interactive commands are\nnot available\nwhen running in\nSecure mode.\nIf you wish to know in advance whether or not your top has been\nsecured, simply ask for help and view the system summary on the\nsecond line.\n<\nEnter\n> or <\nSpace\n>  :\nRefresh-Display\nThese commands awaken top and following receipt of any\ninput the entire display will be repainted.  They also\nforce an update of any hotplugged cpu or physical memory\nchanges.\nUse either of these keys if you have a large delay interval\nand wish to see current status,\n?\n|\nh\n:\nHelp\nThere are two help levels available.  The first will\nprovide a reminder of all the basic interactive commands.\nIf top is\nsecured\n, that screen will be abbreviated.\nTyping âhâ or â?â on that help screen will take you to help\nfor those interactive commands applicable to\nalternate-display mode.\n=\n:\nExit-Display-Limits\nRemoves restrictions on what is shown.  This command will\nreverse any âiâ (idle tasks), ânâ (max tasks), âvâ (hide\nchildren) and âFâ focus commands that might be active.  It\nalso provides for an exit from PID monitoring, User\nfiltering, Other filtering, Locate processing and Combine\nCpus mode.\nAdditionally, if the window has been scrolled it will be\nreset with this command.\n0\n:\nZero-Suppress\ntoggle\nThis command determines whether zeros are shown or\nsuppressed for many of the fields in a task window.  Fields\nlike UID, GID, NI, PR or P are not affected by this toggle.\nA\n:\nAlternate-Display-Mode\ntoggle\nThis command will switch between full-screen mode and\nalternate-display mode.  See topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY\nProvisions and the âgâ interactive command for insight into\nâcurrentâ windows and field groups.\nB\n:\nBold-Disable/Enable\ntoggle\nThis command will influence use of the bold terminfo\ncapability and alters\nboth\nthe summary area and task area\nfor the âcurrentâ window.  While it is intended primarily\nfor use with dumb terminals, it can be applied anytime.\nNote\n: When this toggle is\nOn\nand top is operating in\nmonochrome mode, the\nentire display\nwill appear as normal\ntext.  Thus, unless the âxâ and/or âyâ toggles are using\nreverse for emphasis, there will be no visual confirmation\nthat they are even on.\n*\nd\n|\ns\n:\nChange-Delay-Time-interval\nYou will be prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds,\nbetween display updates.\nFractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is\nnot allowed.  Entering 0 causes (nearly) continuous\nupdates, with an unsatisfactory display as the system and\ntty driver try to keep up with top's demands.  The delay\nvalue is inversely proportional to system loading, so set\nit with care.\nIf at any time you wish to know the current delay time,\nsimply ask for help and view the system summary on the\nsecond line.\nE\n:\nEnforce-Summary-Memory-Scale\nin Summary Area\nWith this command you can cycle through the available\nsummary area memory scaling which ranges from KiB\n(kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through EiB (exbibytes or\n1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes).\nIf you see a â+â between a displayed number and the\nfollowing label, it means that top was forced to truncate\nsome portion of that number.  By raising the scaling\nfactor, such truncation can be avoided.\ne\n:\nEnforce-Task-Memory-Scale\nin Task Area\nWith this command you can cycle through the available task\narea memory scaling which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or\n1,024 bytes) through PiB (pebibytes or\n1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes).\nWhile top will try to honor the selected target range,\nadditional scaling might still be necessary in order to\naccommodate current values.  If you wish to see a more\nhomogeneous result in the memory columns, raising the\nscaling range will usually accomplish that goal.  Raising\nit too high, however, is likely to produce an all zero\nresult which cannot be suppressed with the â0â interactive\ncommand.\ng\n:\nChoose-Another-Window/Field-Group\nYou will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4\ndesignating the field group which should be made the\nâcurrentâ window.  You will soon grow comfortable with\nthese 4 windows, especially after experimenting with\nalternate-display mode.\nH\n:\nThreads-mode\ntoggle\nWhen this toggle is\nOn\n, individual threads will be\ndisplayed for all processes in all visible task windows.\nOtherwise, top displays a summation of all threads in each\nprocess.\nI\n:\nIrix/Solaris-Mode\ntoggle\nWhen operating in Solaris mode (âIâ toggled\nOff\n), a task's\ncpu usage will be divided by the total number of CPUs.\nAfter issuing this command, you'll be told the new state of\nthis toggle.\n*\nk\n:\nKill-a-task\nYou will be prompted for a PID and then the signal to send.\nEntering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as\nthe default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed).\nA PID value of zero means the top program itself.\nThe default signal, as reflected in the prompt, is SIGTERM.\nHowever, you can send any signal, via number or name.\nIf you wish to abort the kill process, do one of the\nfollowing depending on your progress:\n1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number\n2) at the signal prompt, type 0 (or any invalid signal)\n3) at any prompt, type <Esc>\nq\n:\nQuit\n*\nr\n:\nRenice-a-Task\nYou will be prompted for a PID and then the value to nice\nit to.\nEntering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as\nthe default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed).\nA PID value of zero means the top program itself.\nA positive nice value will cause a process to lose\npriority.  Conversely, a negative nice value will cause a\nprocess to be viewed more favorably by the kernel.  As a\ngeneral rule, ordinary users can only increase the nice\nvalue and are prevented from lowering it.\nIf you wish to abort the renice process, do one of the\nfollowing depending on your progress:\n1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number\n2) at the nice prompt, type <Enter> with no input\n3) at any prompt, type <Esc>\nW\n:\nWrite-the-Configuration-File\nThis will save all of your options and toggles plus the\ncurrent display mode and delay time.  By issuing this\ncommand just before quitting top, you will be able restart\nlater in exactly that same state.\nX\n:\nExtra-Fixed-Width\nSome fields are fixed width and not scalable.  As such,\nthey are subject to truncation which would be indicated by\na â+â in the last position.\nThis interactive command can be used to alter the widths of\nthe following fields:\nfield\ndefault\nfield\ndefault\nfield\ndefault\nGID       5       Docker    8       WCHAN      10\nLOGID     5       GROUP     8       nsCGROUP   10\nRUID      5       LXC       8       nsIPC      10\nSUID      5       RUSER     8       nsMNT      10\nUID       5       SUSER     8       nsNET      10\nTTY       8       nsPID      10\nUSER      8       nsTIME     10\nnsUSER     10\nnsUTS      10\nYou will be prompted for the amount to be added to the\ndefault widths shown above.  Entering zero forces a return\nto those defaults.\nIf you enter a negative number, top will automatically\nincrease the column size as needed until there is no more\ntruncated data.\nNote\n: Whether explicitly or automatically increased, the\nwidths for these fields are never decreased by top.  To\nnarrow them you must specify a smaller number or restore\nthe defaults.\nY\n:\nInspect-Other-Output\nAfter issuing the âYâ interactive command, you will be\nprompted for a target PID.  Typing a value or accepting the\ndefault results in a separate screen.  That screen can be\nused to view a variety of files or piped command output\nwhile the normal top iterative display is paused.\nNote\n: This interactive command is only fully realized when\nsupporting entries have been manually added to the end of\nthe top configuration file.  For details on creating those\nentries, see topic 6b. ADDING INSPECT Entries.\nMost of the keys used to navigate the Inspect feature are\nreflected in its header prologue.  There are, however,\nadditional keys available once you have selected a\nparticular file or command.  They are familiar to anyone\nwho has used the pager âlessâ and are summarized here for\nfuture reference.\nkey\nfunction\n=        alternate status-line, file or pipeline\n/        find, equivalent to âLâ locate\nn        find next, equivalent to â&â locate next\n<Space>  scroll down, equivalent to <PgDn>\nb        scroll up, equivalent to <PgUp>\ng        first line, equivalent to <Home>\nG        last line, equivalent to <End>\nZ\n:\nChange-Color-Mapping\nThis key will take you to a separate screen where you can\nchange the colors for the âcurrentâ window, or for all\nwindows.  For details regarding this interactive command\nsee topic 4e. COLOR Mapping.\n^E\n:\nScale-CPU-Time-fields\n(Ctrl key + âeâ)\nThe âtimeâ fields are normally displayed with the greatest\nprecision their widths permit.  This toggle reduces that\nprecision until it wraps.  It also illustrates the scaling\nthose fields\nmight\nexperience automatically, which usually\ndepends on how long the system runs.\nFor example, if âMMM:SS.hhâ is shown, each ^E keystroke\nwould change it to: âMM:SSâ, âHours,MMâ, âDays+Hoursâ and\nfinally âWeeks+Daysâ.\nNot all time fields are subject to the full range of such\nscaling.\n*\n^R\n:\nRenice-an-Autogroup\n(Ctrl key + ârâ)\nYou will be prompted for a PID and then the value for its\nautogroup AGNI.\nEntering no PID will be interpreted as the default shown in\nthe prompt (the first task displayed).\nA positive AGNI value will cause processes in that\nautogroup to lose priority.  Conversely, a negative value\ncauses them to be viewed more favorably by the kernel.\nOrdinary users are not allowed to set negative AGNI values.\nIf you wish to abort the renice process type <Esc>.\n*  The commands shown with an asterisk (â*â) are not available in\nSecure mode, nor will they be shown on the level-1 help screen.\n4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands\nThe summary area interactive commands are\nalways available\nin both\nfull-screen mode and alternate-display mode.  They affect the\nbeginning lines of your display and will determine the position of\nmessages and prompts.\nThese commands always impact just the âcurrentâ window/field\ngroup.  See topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions and the âgâ\ninteractive command for insight into âcurrentâ windows and field\ngroups.\nC\n:\nShow-scroll-coordinates\ntoggle\nToggle an informational message which is displayed whenever\nthe message line is not otherwise being used.  For\nadditional information see topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window.\nl\n:\nLoad-Average/Uptime\ntoggle\nThis is also the line containing the program name (possibly\nan alias) when operating in full-screen mode or the\nâcurrentâ window name when operating in alternate-display\nmode.\nt\n:\nTask/Cpu-States\ntoggle\nThis command affects from 2 to many summary area lines,\ndepending on the state of the â1â, â2â or â3â command\ntoggles and whether or not top is running under true SMP.\nThis portion of the summary area is also influenced by the\nâHâ interactive command toggle, as reflected in the total\nlabel which shows either Tasks or Threads.\nThis command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through\nthese modes:\n1. detailed percentages by category\n2. abbreviated user/system and total % + bar graph\n3. abbreviated user/system and total % + block graph\n4. turn off task and cpu states display\nWhen operating in either of the graphic modes, the display\nbecomes much more meaningful when individual CPUs or NUMA\nnodes are also displayed.  See the the â1â, â2â and â3â\ncommands below for additional information.\nm\n:\nMemory/Swap-Usage\ntoggle\nThis command affects the two summary area lines dealing\nwith physical and virtual memory.\nThis command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through\nthese modes:\n1. detailed percentages by memory type\n2. abbreviated % used/total available + bar graph\n3. abbreviated % used/total available + block graph\n4. turn off memory display\n1\n:\nSingle/Separate-Cpu-States\ntoggle\nThis command affects how the âtâ command's Cpu States\nportion is shown.  Although this toggle exists primarily to\nserve massively-parallel SMP machines, it is not restricted\nto solely SMP environments.\nWhen you see â%Cpu(s):â in the summary area, the â1â toggle\nis\nOn\nand all cpu information is gathered in a single line.\nOtherwise, each cpu is displayed separately as: â%Cpu0,\n%Cpu1, ...â up to available screen height.\n2\n:\nNUMA-Nodes/Cpu-Summary\ntoggle\nThis command toggles between the â1â command cpu summary\ndisplay (only) or a summary display plus the cpu usage\nstatistics for each NUMA Node.  It is only available if a\nsystem has the requisite NUMA support.\n3\n:\nExpand-NUMA-Node\nYou will be invited to enter a number representing a NUMA\nNode.  Thereafter, a node summary plus the statistics for\neach cpu in that node will be shown until the â1â, â2â or\nâ4â command toggle is pressed.  This interactive command is\nonly available if a system has the requisite NUMA support.\n4\n:\nDisplay-Multiple-Elements-Adjacent\ntoggle\nThis command toggle turns the â1â toggle\nOff\nand shows\nmultiple CPU and Memory results on each line.  Each\nsuccessive â4â key adds another CPU until again reverting\nto separate lines for CPU and Memory results.\nA maximum of 8 CPUs per line can be displayed in this\nmanner.  However, data truncation may occur before reaching\nthe maximum.  That is definitely true when displaying\ndetailed statistics via the âtâ command toggle since such\ndata cannot be scaled like the graphic representations.\nIf one wished to quickly exit adjacent mode without cycling\nall the way to 8, simply use the â1â command toggle.\n5\n:\nDisplay-P-Cores-and-E-Cores\ntoggle\nThis command toggle is only active when the âtâ toggle is\nOn\nand the â1â, â2â, â3â and â!â toggles are\nOff\n, thus\nshowing individual CPU results.  It assumes a platform has\nmultiple cores of two distinct types, either multi-threaded\n(P-Core) or single-threaded (E-Core).\nWhile normally each cpu is displayed as â%Cpu0, %Cpu1,\n...â, this toggle can be used to identify and/or filter\nthose cpus by their core type, either P-Core (performance)\nor E-Core (efficient).\nThe 1st time â5â is struck, each CPU is displayed as â%Cp\nP\nâ\nor â%Cp\nE\nâ representing the two core types.  The 2nd time,\nonly P-Cores (%Cp\nP\n) will be shown.  The 3rd time, only E-\nCores (%Cp\nE\n) are displayed.  When this command toggle is\nstruck for the 4th time, the CPU display returns to the\nnormal â%Cpuâ convention.\nIf separate\nperformance\nand\nefficient\ncategories are not\npresent, this command toggle will have no effect.\n!\n:\nCombine-Cpus-Mode\ntoggle\nThis command toggle is intended for massively parallel SMP\nenvironments where, even with the â4â command toggle, not\nall processors can be displayed.  With each press of â!â\nthe number of cpus combined is doubled thus reducing the\ntotal number of cpu lines displayed.\nFor example, with the first press of â!â two cpus will be\ncombined and displayed as â0-1, 2-3, ...â instead of the\nnormal â%Cpu0, %Cpu1, %Cpu2, %Cpu3, ...â.  With a second\nâ!â command toggle four cpus are combined and shown as\nâ0-3, 4-7, ...â.  Then the third â!â press, combining eight\ncpus, shows as â0-7, 8-15, ...â, etc.\nSuch progression continues until individual cpus are again\ndisplayed and impacts both the â1â and â4â toggles (one or\nmultiple columns).  Use the â=â command to exit\nCombine\nCpus\nmode.\nNote\n: If the entire summary area has been toggled\nOff\nfor any\nwindow, you would be left with just the\nmessage line\n.  In that\nway, you will have maximized available task rows but (temporarily)\nsacrificed the program name in full-screen mode or the âcurrentâ\nwindow name when in alternate-display mode.\n4c. TASK AREA Commands\nThe task area interactive commands are\nalways\navailable in\nfull-screen mode.\nThe task area interactive commands are\nnever available\nin\nalternate-display mode\nif\nthe âcurrentâ window's task display has\nbeen toggled\nOff\n(see topic 5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions).\nAPPEARANCE\nof task window\nJ\n:\nJustify-Numeric-Columns\ntoggle\nAlternates between right-justified (the default) and left-\njustified numeric data.  If the numeric data completely\nfills the available column, this command toggle may impact\nthe column header only.\nj\n:\nJustify-Character-Columns\ntoggle\nAlternates between left-justified (the default) and right-\njustified character data.  If the character data completely\nfills the available column, this command toggle may impact\nthe column header only.\nThe following commands will also be influenced by the state of\nthe global âBâ (bold enable) toggle.\nb\n:\nBold/Reverse\ntoggle\nThis command will impact how the âxâ and âyâ toggles are\ndisplayed.  It may also impact the summary area when a bar\ngraph has been selected for cpu states or memory usage via\nthe âtâ or âmâ toggles.\nx\n:\nColumn-Highlight\ntoggle\nChanges highlighting for the current sort field.  If you\nforget which field is being sorted this command can serve\nas a quick visual reminder, providing the sort field is\nbeing displayed.  The sort field might\nnot\nbe visible\nbecause:\n1) there is insufficient\nScreen Width\n2) the âfâ interactive command turned it\nOff\ny\n:\nRow-Highlight\ntoggle\nChanges highlighting for \"running\" tasks.  For additional\ninsight into this task state, see topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of\nFields, the âSâ field (Process Status).\nUse of this provision provides important insight into your\nsystem's health.  The only costs will be a few additional\ntty escape sequences.\nz\n:\nColor/Monochrome\ntoggle\nSwitches the âcurrentâ window between your last used color\nscheme and the older form of black-on-white or white-on-\nblack.  This command will alter\nboth\nthe summary area and\ntask area but does not affect the state of the âxâ, âyâ or\nâbâ toggles.\nCONTENT\nof task window\nc\n:\nCommand-Line/Program-Name\ntoggle\nThis command will be honored whether or not the COMMAND\ncolumn is currently visible.  Later, should that field come\ninto view, the change you applied will be seen.\nF\n:\nMaintain-Parent-Focus\ntoggle\nWhen in forest view mode, this key serves as a toggle to\nretain focus on a target task, presumably one with forked\nchildren.  If forest view mode is\nOff\nthis key has no\neffect.\nThe toggle is applied to the first (topmost) process in the\nâcurrentâ window.  Once established, that task is always\ndisplayed as the first (topmost) process along with its\nforked children.  All other processes will be suppressed.\nNote\n: keys like âiâ (idle tasks), ânâ (max tasks), âvâ\n(hide children) and User/Other filtering remain accessible\nand can impact what is displayed.\nf\n:\nFields-Management\nThis key displays a separate screen where you can change\nwhich fields are displayed, their order and also designate\nthe sort field.  For additional information on this\ninteractive command see topic 3b. MANAGING Fields.\nO\n|\no\n:\nOther-Filtering\nYou will be prompted for the selection criteria which then\ndetermines which tasks will be shown in the âcurrentâ\nwindow.  Your criteria can be made case sensitive or case\ncan be ignored.  And you determine if top should include or\nexclude matching tasks.\nSee topic 5e. FILTERING in a window for details on these\nand additional related interactive commands.\nS\n:\nCumulative-Time-Mode\ntoggle\nWhen Cumulative mode is\nOn\n, each process is listed with the\ncpu time that it and its dead children have used.\nWhen\nOff\n, programs that fork into many separate tasks will\nappear less demanding.  For programs like âinitâ or a shell\nthis is appropriate but for others, like compilers, perhaps\nnot.  Experiment with two task windows sharing the same\nsort field but with different âSâ states and see which\nrepresentation you prefer.\nAfter issuing this command, you'll be informed of the new\nstate of this toggle.  If you wish to know in advance\nwhether or not Cumulative mode is in effect, simply ask for\nhelp and view the window summary on the second line.\nU\n|\nu\n:\nShow-Specific-User-Only\nYou will be prompted for the\nuid\nor\nname\nof the user to\ndisplay.  The -u option matches on\neffective\nuser whereas\nthe -U option matches on\nany\nuser (real, effective, saved,\nor filesystem).\nThereafter, in that task window only matching users will be\nshown, or possibly no processes will be shown.  Prepending\nan exclamation point (â!â) to the user id or name instructs\ntop to display only processes with users not matching the\none provided.\nDifferent task windows can be used to filter different\nusers.  Later, if you wish to monitor all users again in\nthe âcurrentâ window, re-issue this command but just press\n<Enter> at the prompt.\nV\n:\nForest-View-Mode\ntoggle\nIn this mode, processes are reordered according to their\nparents and the layout of the COMMAND column resembles that\nof a tree.  In forest view mode it is still possible to\ntoggle between program name and command line (see the âcâ\ninteractive command) or between processes and threads (see\nthe âHâ interactive command).\nNote\n: Typing any key affecting the sort order will exit\nforest view mode in the âcurrentâ window.  See topic 4c.\nTASK AREA Commands, SORTING for information on those keys.\nv\n:\nHide/Show-Children\ntoggle\nWhen in forest view mode, this key serves as a toggle to\ncollapse or expand the children of a parent.\nThe toggle is applied against the first (topmost) process\nin the âcurrentâ window.  See topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window\nfor additional information regarding vertical scrolling.\nIf the target process has not forked any children, this key\nhas no effect.  It also has no effect when not in forest\nview mode.\nSIZE\nof task window\ni\n:\nIdle-Process\ntoggle\nDisplays all tasks or just active tasks.  When this toggle\nis\nOff\n, tasks that have not used any CPU since the last\nupdate will not be displayed.  However, due to the\ngranularity of the %CPU and TIME+ fields, some processes\nmay still be displayed that\nappear\nto have used\nno\nCPU.\nIf this command is applied to the last task display when in\nalternate-display mode, then it will not affect the\nwindow's size, as all prior task displays will have already\nbeen painted.\nn\n|\n#\n:\nSet-Maximum-Tasks\nYou will be prompted to enter the number of tasks to\ndisplay.  The lessor of your number and available screen\nrows will be used.\nWhen used in alternate-display mode, this is the command\nthat gives you precise control over the size of each\ncurrently visible task display, except for the very last.\nIt will not affect the last window's size, as all prior\ntask displays will have already been painted.\nNote\n: If you wish to increase the size of the last visible\ntask display when in alternate-display mode, simply\ndecrease the size of the task display(s) above it.\nSORTING\nof task window\nFor compatibility, this top supports most of the former top\nsort keys.  Since this is primarily a service to former top\nusers, these commands do not appear on any help screen.\ncommand\nsorted-field\nsupported\nA         start time (non-display)\nNo\nM         %MEM                          Yes\nN         PID                           Yes\nP         %CPU                          Yes\nT         TIME+                         Yes\nBefore using any of the following sort provisions, top suggests\nthat you temporarily turn on column highlighting using the âxâ\ninteractive command.  That will help ensure that the actual\nsort environment matches your intent.\nThe following interactive commands will\nonly\nbe honored when\nthe current sort field is\nvisible\n.  The sort field might\nnot\nbe\nvisible because:\n1) there is insufficient\nScreen Width\n2) the âfâ interactive command turned it\nOff\n<\n:\nMove-Sort-Field-Left\nMoves the sort column to the left unless the current\nsort field is the first field being displayed.\n>\n:\nMove-Sort-Field-Right\nMoves the sort column to the right unless the current\nsort field is the last field being displayed.\nThe following interactive commands will\nalways\nbe honored\nwhether or not the current sort field is visible.\nf\n:\nFields-Management\nThis key displays a separate screen where you can change\nwhich field is used as the sort column, among other\nfunctions.  This can be a convenient way to simply\nverify the current sort field, when running top with\ncolumn highlighting turned\nOff\n.\nR\n:\nReverse/Normal-Sort-Field\ntoggle\nUsing this interactive command you can alternate between\nhigh-to-low and low-to-high sorts.\n4d. BOTTOM WINDOW Commands\nThese keys invoke a separate window at the bottom of the screen\nwhile normal top monitoring continues uninterrupted.  Keying the\nsame\nâCtrlâ command a second time removes that separate window as\ndoes the â=â command.\n^A\n:\nDisplay-Capabilities\n(Ctrl key + âaâ)\n^G\n:\nDisplay-Control-Groups\n(Ctrl key + âgâ)\n^K\n:\nDisplay-Cmdline\n(Ctrl key + âkâ)\n^L\n:\nDisplay-Logged-Messages\n(Ctrl key + âlâ)\n^N\n:\nDisplay-Environment\n(Ctrl key + ânâ)\n^P\n:\nDisplay-Namesspaces\n(Ctrl key + âpâ)\n^U\n:\nDisplay-Supplementary-Groups\n(Ctrl key + âuâ)\nExcept for the Ctrl+L command, all the above keys are applied to\nthe first process displayed and will show that task's full\n(potentially wrapped) information.  Thus, the Up/Down arrow keys\nor their aliases will be important.\nThe\nTab\nkey or\nShift+Tab\ncombination can be used to highlight\nindividual elements being displayed in the bottom window.\nNotable among these provisions is the Ctrl+N (environment)\ncommand.  Its output can be extensive and not easily read when\nline wrapped.  A more readable version can be achieved with an\nâInspectâ entry in the rcfile like the following.\npipe ^I Environment ^I cat /proc/%d/environ | tr '\\0' '\\n'\nSee the âYâ interactive command under 4a. GLOBAL Commands and\ntopic 6b. ADDING INSPECT Entries for additional information.\nUnlike the other commands,\nCtrl+L\n(logged messages) is not\nassociated with a specific task.  Rather, up to 10 of the most\nrecent messages issued by top are recalled for review.\n4e. COLOR Mapping\nWhen you issue the âZâ interactive command, you will be presented\nwith a separate screen.  That screen can be used to change the\ncolors in just the âcurrentâ window or in all four windows before\nreturning to the top display.\nThe following interactive commands are available.\n5\nupper case letters to select a\ntarget\n8\nnumbers to select a\ncolor\n(@ selects no color)\nnormal toggles available\nB         :bold disable/enable\nb         :running tasks \"bold\"/reverse\nz         :color/mono\nother commands available\na/w       :apply, then go to next/prior\n<Enter>   :apply and exit\nq         :abandon current changes and exit\nIf you use âaâ or âwâ to cycle the targeted window, you will have\napplied the color scheme that was displayed when you left that\nwindow.  You can, of course, easily return to any window and\nreapply different colors or turn colors\nOff\ncompletely with the\nâzâ toggle.\nThe Color Mapping screen can also be used to change the âcurrentâ\nwindow/field group in either full-screen mode or alternate-display\nmode.  Whatever was targeted when âqâ or <Enter> was pressed will\nbe made current as you return to the top display.\n5. ALTERNATE-DISPLAY Provisions\ntop\n5a. WINDOWS Overview\nField Groups/Windows\n:\nIn full-screen mode there is a single window represented by the\nentire screen.  That single window can still be changed to\ndisplay 1 of 4 different\nfield groups\n(see the âgâ interactive\ncommand, repeated below).  Each of the 4 field groups has a\nunique separately configurable\nsummary area\nand its own\nconfigurable\ntask area\n.\nIn alternate-display mode, those 4 underlying field groups can\nnow be made visible simultaneously, or can be turned\nOff\nindividually at your command.\nThe summary area will always exist, even if it's only the\nmessage line.  At any given time only\none\nsummary area can be\ndisplayed.  However, depending on your commands, there could be\nfrom\nzero\nto\nfour\nseparate task displays currently showing on\nthe screen.\nCurrent Window\n:\nThe âcurrentâ window is the window associated with the summary\narea and the window to which task related commands are always\ndirected.  Since in alternate-display mode you can toggle the\ntask display\nOff\n, some commands might be restricted for the\nâcurrentâ window.\nA further complication arises when you have toggled the first\nsummary area line\nOff\n.  With the loss of the window name (the\nâlâ toggled line), you'll not easily know what window is the\nâcurrentâ window.\n5b. COMMANDS for Windows\n-\n|\n_\n:\nShow/Hide-Window(s)\ntoggles\nThe â-â key turns the âcurrentâ window's task display\nOn\nand\nOff\n.  When\nOn\n, that task area will show a minimum of\nthe columns header you've established with the âfâ\ninteractive command.  It will also reflect any other task\narea options/toggles you've applied yielding zero or more\ntasks.\nThe â_â key does the same for all task displays.  In other\nwords, it switches between the currently visible task\ndisplay(s) and any task display(s) you had toggled\nOff\n.  If\nall 4 task displays are currently visible, this interactive\ncommand will leave the summary area as the only display\nelement.\n*\n=\n|\n+\n:\nEqualize/Reset-Window(s)\nThe â=â key forces the âcurrentâ window's task display to\nbe visible.  It also reverses any active âiâ (idle tasks),\nânâ (max tasks), âu/Uâ (user filter), âo/Oâ (other filter),\nâvâ (hide children), âFâ focused, âLâ (locate) and â!â\n(combine cpus) commands.  Also, if the window had been\nscrolled, it will be reset with this command.  See topic\n5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information regarding\nvertical and horizontal scrolling.\nThe â+â key does the same for all windows.  The four task\ndisplays will reappear, evenly balanced, while retaining\nany customizations previously applied beyond those noted\nfor the â=â command toggle.\n*\nA\n:\nAlternate-Display-Mode\ntoggle\nThis command will switch between full-screen mode and\nalternate-display mode.\nThe first time you issue this command, all four task\ndisplays will be shown.  Thereafter when you switch modes,\nyou will see only the task display(s) you've chosen to make\nvisible.\n*\na\n|\nw\n:\nNext-Window-Forward/Backward\nThis will change the âcurrentâ window, which in turn\nchanges the window to which commands are directed.  These\nkeys act in a circular fashion so you can reach any desired\nwindow using either key.\nAssuming the window name is visible (you have not toggled\nâlâ\nOff\n), whenever the âcurrentâ window name loses its\nemphasis/color, that's a reminder the task display is\nOff\nand many commands will be restricted.\nG\n:\nChange-Window/Field-Group-Name\nYou will be prompted for a new name to be applied to the\nâcurrentâ window.  It does not require that the window name\nbe visible (the âlâ toggle to be\nOn\n).\n*  The interactive commands shown with an asterisk (â*â) have use\nbeyond alternate-display mode.\n=, A, g    are always available\na, w       act the same with color mapping\nand fields management\n*\ng\n:\nChoose-Another-Window/Field-Group\nYou will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4\ndesignating the field group which should be made the\nâcurrentâ window.\nIn full-screen mode, this command is necessary to alter the\nâcurrentâ window.  In alternate-display mode, it is simply\na less convenient alternative to the âaâ and âwâ commands.\n5c. SCROLLING a Window\nTypically a task window is a partial view into a system's total\ntasks/threads which shows only some of the available\nfields/columns.  With these scrolling keys, you can move that view\nvertically or horizontally to reveal any desired task or column.\nUp\n,\nPgUp\n:\nScroll-Tasks\nMove the view up toward the first task row, until the first\ntask is displayed at the top of the âcurrentâ window.  The\nUp\narrow key moves a single line while\nPgUp\nscrolls the entire\nwindow.\nDown\n,\nPgDn\n:\nScroll-Tasks\nMove the view down toward the last task row, until the last\ntask is the only task displayed at the top of the âcurrentâ\nwindow.  The\nDown\narrow key moves a single line while\nPgDn\nscrolls the entire window.\nLeft\n,\nRight\n:\nScroll-Columns\nMove the view of displayable fields horizontally one column at\na time.\nNote\n: As a reminder, some fields/columns are not fixed-width\nbut allocated all remaining screen width when visible.  When\nscrolling right or left, that feature may produce some\nunexpected results initially.\nAdditionally, there are special provisions for any variable\nwidth field when positioned as the last displayed field.  Once\nthat field is reached via the right arrow key, and is thus the\nonly column shown, you can continue scrolling horizontally\nwithin such a field.  See the âCâ interactive command below\nfor additional information.\nHome\n:\nJump-to-Home-Position\nReposition the display to the un-scrolled coordinates.\nEnd\n:\nJump-to-End-Position\nReposition the display so that the rightmost column reflects\nthe last displayable field and the bottom task row represents\nthe last task.\nNote\n: From this position it is still possible to scroll\ndown\nand\nright\nusing the arrow keys.  This is true until a single\ncolumn and a single task is left as the only display element.\nC\n:\nShow-scroll-coordinates\ntoggle\nToggle an informational message which is displayed whenever\nthe message line is not otherwise being used.  That message\nwill take one of two forms depending on whether or not a\nvariable width column has also been scrolled.\nscroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields)\nscroll coordinates: y = n/n (tasks), x = n/n (fields)\n+ nn\nThe coordinates shown as\nn\n/\nn\nare relative to the upper left\ncorner of the âcurrentâ window.  The additional â\n+ nn\nâ\nrepresents the displacement into a variable width column when\nit has been scrolled horizontally.  Such displacement occurs\nin normal 8 character tab stop amounts via the right and left\narrow keys.\ny = n/n (tasks)\nThe first\nn\nrepresents the topmost visible task and is\ncontrolled by scrolling keys.  The second\nn\nis updated\nautomatically to reflect total tasks.\nx = n/n (fields)\nThe first\nn\nrepresents the leftmost displayed column and\nis controlled by scrolling keys.  The second\nn\nis the\ntotal number of displayable fields and is established with\nthe â\nf\nâ interactive command.\nThe above interactive commands are\nalways\navailable in full-screen\nmode but\nnever\navailable in alternate-display mode if the\nâcurrentâ window's task display has been toggled\nOff\n.\nNote\n: When any form of filtering is active, you can expect some\nslight aberrations when scrolling since not all tasks will be\nvisible.  This is particularly apparent when using the Up/Down\narrow keys.\n5d. SEARCHING in a Window\nYou can use these interactive commands to locate a task row\ncontaining a particular value.\nL\n:\nLocate-a-string\nYou will be prompted for the case-sensitive string to locate\nstarting from the current window coordinates.  There are no\nrestrictions on search string content.\nSearches are not limited to values from a single field or\ncolumn.  All of the values displayed in a task row are allowed\nin a search string.  You may include spaces, numbers, symbols\nand even forest view artwork.\nKeying <Enter> with no input will effectively disable the â&â\nkey until a new search string is entered.\n&\n:\nLocate-next\nAssuming a search string has been established, top will\nattempt to locate the next occurrence.\nWhen a match is found, the current window is repositioned\nvertically so the task row containing that string is first.  The\nscroll coordinates message can provide confirmation of such\nvertical repositioning (see the âCâ interactive command).\nHorizontal scrolling, however, is never altered via searching.\nThe availability of a matching string will be influenced by the\nfollowing factors.\na. Which fields are displayable from the total available,\nsee topic 3b. MANAGING Fields.\nb. Scrolling a window vertically and/or horizontally,\nsee topic 5c. SCROLLING a Window.\nc. The state of the command/command-line toggle,\nsee the âcâ interactive command.\nd. The stability of the chosen sort column,\nfor example PID is good but %CPU bad.\nIf a search fails, restoring the âcurrentâ window home\n(unscrolled) position, scrolling horizontally, displaying command-\nlines or choosing a more stable sort field could yet produce a\nsuccessful â&â search.\nThe above interactive commands are\nalways\navailable in full-screen\nmode but\nnever\navailable in alternate-display mode if the\nâcurrentâ window's task display has been toggled\nOff\n.\n5e. FILTERING in a Window\nYou can use this âOther Filterâ feature to establish selection\ncriteria which will then determine which tasks are shown in the\nâcurrentâ window.  Such filters can be made persistent if\npreserved in the rcfile via the âWâ interactive command.\nEstablishing a filter requires: 1) a field name; 2) an operator;\nand 3) a selection value, as a minimum.  This is the most complex\nof top's user input requirements so, when you make a mistake,\ncommand recall will be your friend.  Remember the Up/Down arrow\nkeys or their aliases when prompted for input.\nFilter Basics\n1. field names are case sensitive and spelled as in the header\n2. selection values need not comprise the full displayed field\n3. a selection is either case insensitive or sensitive to case\n4. the default is inclusion, prepending â!â denotes exclusions\n5. multiple selection criteria can be applied to a task window\n6. inclusion and exclusion criteria can be used simultaneously\n7. the 1 equality and 2 relational filters can be freely mixed\n8. separate unique filters are maintained for each task window\nIf a field is not turned on or is not currently in view, then\nyour selection criteria will not affect the display.  Later,\nshould a filtered field become visible, the selection criteria\nwill then be applied.\nKeyboard Summary\nO\n:\nOther-Filter\n(upper case)\nYou will be prompted to establish a\ncase sensitive\nfilter.\no\n:\nOther-Filter\n(lower case)\nYou will be prompted to establish a filter that\nignores case\nwhen matching.\n^O\n:\nShow-Active-Filters\n(Ctrl key + âoâ)\nThis can serve as a reminder of which filters are active in\nthe âcurrentâ window.  A summary will be shown on the\nmessage line until you press the <Enter> key.\n=\n:\nReset-Filtering\nin current window\nThis clears all of your selection criteria in the âcurrentâ\nwindow.  It also has additional impact so please see topic\n4a. GLOBAL Commands.\n+\n:\nReset-Filtering\nin all windows\nThis clears the selection criteria in all windows, assuming\nyou are in alternate-display mode.  As with the â=â\ninteractive command, it too has additional consequences so\nyou might wish to see topic 5b.  COMMANDS for Windows.\nInput Requirements\nWhen prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must\ntake one of two forms.  There are 3 required pieces of\ninformation, with a 4th as optional.  These examples use spaces\nfor clarity but your input generally would not.\n#1\n#2\n#3              ( required )\nField-Name   ?   include-if-value\n!\nField-Name   ?\nexclude\n-if-value\n#4                                  ( optional )\nItems #1, #3 and #4 should be self-explanatory.  Item\n#2\nrepresents both a required\ndelimiter\nand the\noperator\nwhich\nmust be one of either equality (â=â) or relation (â<â or â>â).\nThe â=â equality operator requires only a partial match and\nthat can reduce your âif-valueâ input requirements.  The â>â or\nâ<â relational operators always employ string comparisons, even\nwith numeric fields.  They are designed to work with a field's\ndefault\njustification\nand with homogeneous data.  When some\nfield's numeric amounts have been subjected to\nscaling\nwhile\nothers have not, that data is no longer homogeneous.\nIf you establish a relational filter and you\nhave\nchanged the\ndefault Numeric or Character\njustification\n, that filter is\nlikely to fail.  When a relational filter is applied to a\nmemory field and you\nhave not\nchanged the\nscaling\n, it may\nproduce misleading results.  This happens, for example, because\nâ100.0mâ (MiB) would appear greater than â1.000gâ (GiB) when\ncompared as strings.\nIf your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering\njustification or scaling may yet achieve the desired objective.\nSee the âjâ, âJâ and âeâ interactive commands for additional\ninformation.\nPotential Problems\nThese\nGROUP\nfilters could produce the exact same results or the\nsecond one might not display anything at all, just a blank task\nwindow.\nGROUP=root        ( only the same results when )\nGROUP=ROOT        ( invoked via lower case âoâ )\nEither of these\nRES\nfilters might yield inconsistent and/or\nmisleading results, depending on the current memory scaling\nfactor.  Or both filters could produce the exact same results.\nRES>9999          ( only the same results when )\n!RES<10000        ( memory scaling is at âKiBâ )\nThis\nnMin\nfilter illustrates a problem unique to scalable\nfields.  This particular field can display a maximum of 4\ndigits, beyond which values are automatically scaled to KiB or\nabove.  So while amounts greater than 9999 exist, they will\nappear as 2.6m, 197k, etc.\nnMin>9999         ( always a blank task window )\nPotential Solutions\nThese examples illustrate how Other Filtering can be creatively\napplied to achieve almost any desired result.  Single quotes\nare sometimes shown to delimit the spaces which are part of a\nfilter or to represent a request for status (^O) accurately.\nBut if you used them with if-values in real life, no matches\nwould be found.\nAssuming field\nnTH\nis displayed, the first filter will result\nin only multi-threaded processes being shown.  It also reminds\nus that a trailing space is part of every displayed field.  The\nsecond filter achieves the exact same results with less typing.\n!nTH=â 1 â                ( ââ for clarity only )\nnTH>1                     ( same with less i/p )\nWith Forest View mode active and the\nCOMMAND\ncolumn in view,\nthis filter effectively collapses child processes so that just\n3 levels are shown.\n!COMMAND=â       â- â   ( ââ for clarity only )\nThe final two filters appear as in response to the status\nrequest key (^O).  In reality, each filter would have required\nseparate input.  The\nPR\nexample shows the two concurrent\nfilters necessary to display tasks with priorities of 20 or\nmore, since some might be negative.  Then by exploiting\ntrailing spaces, the\nnMin\nseries of filters could achieve the\nfailed â9999â objective discussed above.\nâPR>20â + â!PR=-â         ( 2 for right result )\nâ!nMin=0 â + â!nMin=1 â + â!nMin=2 â + â!nMin=3 â ...\n6. FILES\ntop\n6a. PERSONAL Configuration File\nThis file is created or updated via the âWâ interactive command.\nThe legacy version is written as â$HOME/.your-name-4-topâ + ârcâ\nwith a leading period.\nA newly created configuration file is written as\nâprocps/your-name-4-topâ + ârcâ without a leading period.  The\nprocps directory will be subordinate to either $XDG_CONFIG_HOME\nwhen set as an absolute path or the $HOME/.config directory.\nWhile not intended to be edited manually, here is the general\nlayout:\nglobal   # line  1: the program name/alias notation\n\"      # line  2: id,altscr,irixps,delay,curwin\nper ea   # line  a: winname,fieldscur\nwindow   # line  b: winflags,sortindx,maxtasks,etc\n\"      # line  c: summclr,msgsclr,headclr,taskclr\nglobal   # line 15: additional miscellaneous settings\n\"      # any remaining lines are devoted to optional\n\"      # active âother filtersâ discussed in section 5e above\n\"      # plus âinspectâ entries discussed in section 6b below\nIf a valid absolute path to the rcfile cannot be established,\ncustomizations made to a running top will be impossible to\npreserve.\n6b. ADDING INSPECT Entries\nTo exploit the âYâ interactive command, you must add entries at\nthe\nend\nof the top personal configuration file.  Such entries\nsimply reflect a file to be read or command/pipeline to be\nexecuted whose results will then be displayed in a separate\nscrollable, searchable window.\nIf you don't know the location or name of your top rcfile, use the\nâWâ interactive command to rewrite it and note those details.\nInspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing\nthe configuration file.  Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the\nrcfile should it replace (>) rather than append (>>) to that file.\nConversely, when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt\nexisting lines, some of which could contain unprintable data or\nunusual characters depending on the top version under which that\nconfiguration file was saved.\nThose Inspect entries beginning with a â#â character are ignored,\nregardless of content.  Otherwise they consist of the following 3\nelements, each of which\nmust\nbe separated by a tab character (thus\n2 â\\tâ total):\n.type:  literal âfileâ or âpipeâ\n.name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen\n.fmts:  string representing a path or command\nThe two types of Inspect entries are\nnot\ninterchangeable.  Those\ndesignated â\nfile\nâ will be accessed using fopen and must reference\na single file in the â.fmtsâ element.  Entries specifying â\npipe\nâ\nwill employ popen, their â.fmtsâ element could contain many\npipelined commands and, none can be interactive.\nIf the file or pipeline represented in your â.fmtsâ deals with the\nspecific PID input or accepted when prompted, then the format\nstring must also contain the â\n%d\nâ specifier, as these examples\nillustrate.\n.fmts=  /proc/\n%d\n/numa_maps\n.fmts=  lsof -P -p\n%d\nFor â\npipe\nâ type entries only, you may also wish to redirect stderr\nto stdout for a more comprehensive result.  Thus the format string\nbecomes:\n.fmts=  pmap -x %d\n2>&1\nHere are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might\nappear in the rcfile.  The first entry will be ignored due to the\ninitial â#â character.  For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions\n(^I) are surrounded by an extra space but the actual tabs would\nnot be.\n# pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2>&1\npipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2>&1\nfile ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps\npipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr\nExcept for the commented entry above, these next examples show\nwhat could be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the\nrcfile name was â.toprcâ.  However, due to the embedded tab\ncharacters, each of these lines should be preceded by â\n/bin/echo\n-e\nâ, not just a simple an âechoâ, to enable backslash\ninterpretation regardless of which shell you use.\n\"pipe\\tOpen Files\\tlsof -P -p %d 2>&1\" >> ~/.toprc\n\"file\\tNUMA Info\\t/proc/%d/numa_maps\" >> ~/.toprc\n\"pipe\\tLog\\ttail -n200 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr\" >> ~/.toprc\nIf any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable\ncharacters they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or\nhexadecimal <FF> form, depending on their value.  This applies to\ntab characters as well, which will show as â^Iâ.  If you want a\ntruer representation, any embedded tabs should be expanded.  The\nfollowing example takes what could have been a âfileâ entry but\nemploys a âpipeâ instead so as to expand the embedded tabs.\n# next would have contained â\\tâ ...\n# file ^I <your_name> ^I /proc/%d/status\n# but this will eliminate embedded â\\tâ ...\npipe ^I <your_name> ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand -\nNote\n: Some programs might rely on\nSIGINT\nto end.  Therefore, if a\nâ\npipe\nâ such as the following is established, one must use Ctrl-C\nto terminate it in order to review the results.  This is the\nsingle occasion where a â^Câ will not also terminate top.\npipe ^I Trace ^I /usr/bin/strace -p %d 2>&1\nLastly, while â\npipe\nâ type entries have been discussed in terms of\npipelines and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from\nincluding\nshell scripts\nas well.  Perhaps even newly created\nscripts designed specifically for the âYâ interactive command.\nFor example, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over\ntime, the âOptions:â row will be truncated when screen width is\nexceeded.  That does not affect operation other than to make some\nselections invisible.  However, if some choices are lost to\ntruncation but you want to see more options, there is an easy\nsolution hinted at below.\nInspection Pause at pid ...\nUse:  left/right then <Enter> ...\nOptions:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...\nThe entries in the top rcfile would have a number for the â.nameâ\nelement and the âhelpâ entry would identify a shell script you've\nwritten explaining what those numbered selections actually mean.\nIn that way, many more choices can be made visible.\n6c. SYSTEM Configuration File\nThis configuration file represents defaults for users who have not\nsaved their own configuration file.  The format mirrors exactly\nthe personal configuration file and can also include âinspectâ\nentries as explained above.\nCreating it is a simple process.\n1. Configure top appropriately for your installation and preserve\nthat configuration with the âWâ interactive command.\n2. Add and test any desired âinspectâ entries.\n3. Copy that configuration file to the\n/etc/\ndirectory as\nâ\ntopdefaultrc\nâ.\n6d. SYSTEM Restrictions File\nThe presence of this file will influence which version of the help\nscreen is shown to an ordinary user.\nMore importantly, it will limit what ordinary users are allowed to\ndo when top is running.  They will not be able to issue the\nfollowing commands.\nk        Kill a task\nr        Renice a task\nd or s   Change delay/sleep interval\nThis configuration file is not created by top.  Rather, it is\ncreated manually and placed it in the\n/etc/\ndirectory as â\ntoprc\nâ.\nIt should have exactly two lines, as shown in this example:\ns        # line 1: secure mode switch\n5.0      # line 2: delay interval in seconds\n7. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE(S)\ntop\nThe value set for the following is unimportant, just its presence.\nLIBPROC_HIDE_KERNEL\nThis will prevent display of any kernel threads and exclude\nsuch processes from the summary area Tasks/Threads counts.\n8. STUPID TRICKS Sampler\ntop\nMany of these tricks work best when you give top a scheduling\nboost.  So plan on starting him with a nice value of -10, assuming\nyou've got the authority.\n8a. Kernel Magic\nFor these stupid tricks, top needs full-screen mode.\nâ¢  The user interface, through prompts and help, intentionally\nimplies that the delay interval is limited to tenths of a\nsecond.  However, you're free to set any desired delay.  If you\nwant to see Linux at his scheduling best, try a delay of .09\nseconds or less.\nFor this experiment, under x-windows open an xterm and maximize\nit.  Then do the following:\n. provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:\nnice -n -10 top -d.09\n. keep sorted column highlighting\nOff\nso as to\nminimize path length\n. turn\nOn\nreverse row highlighting for emphasis\n. try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well),\nand normal or reverse sorts to bring the most\nactive processes into view\nWhat you'll see is a very busy Linux doing what he's always\ndone for you, but there was no program available to illustrate\nthis.\nâ¢  Under an xterm using âwhite-on-blackâ colors, on top's Color\nMapping screen set the task color to black and be sure that\ntask highlighting is set to bold, not reverse.  Then set the\ndelay interval to around .3 seconds.\nAfter bringing the most active processes into view, what you'll\nsee are the ghostly images of just the currently running tasks.\nâ¢  Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink.  Start\nthis new version then type âTâ (a secret key, see topic 4c.\nTask Area Commands, SORTING) followed by âWâ and âqâ.  Finally,\nrestart the program with -d0 (zero delay).\nYour display will be refreshed at three times the rate of the\nformer top, a 300% speed advantage.  As top climbs the TIME\nladder, be as patient as you can while speculating on whether\nor not top will ever reach the top.\n8b. Bouncing Windows\nFor these stupid tricks, top needs alternate-display mode.\nâ¢  With 3 or 4 task displays visible, pick any window other than\nthe last and turn idle processes\nOff\nusing the âiâ command\ntoggle.  Depending on where you applied âiâ, sometimes several\ntask displays are bouncing and sometimes it's like an\naccordion, as top tries his best to allocate space.\nâ¢  Set each window's summary lines differently: one with no memory\n(âmâ); another with no states (âtâ); maybe one with nothing at\nall, just the message line.  Then hold down âaâ or âwâ and\nwatch a variation on bouncing windows  --  hopping windows.\nâ¢  Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes\nto\nOff\nusing the âiâ command toggle.  You've just entered the\n\"extreme bounce\" zone.\n8c. The Big Bird Window\nThis stupid trick also requires alternate-display mode.\nâ¢  Display all 4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the âcurrentâ\nwindow.  Then, keep increasing window size with the ânâ\ninteractive command until all the other task displays are\n\"pushed out of the nest\".\nWhen they've all been displaced, toggle between all\nvisible/invisible windows using the â_â command toggle.  Then\nponder this:\nis top fibbing or telling honestly your imposed truth?\n8d. The Ol' Switcheroo\nThis stupid trick works best without alternate-display mode, since\njustification is active on a per window basis.\nâ¢  Start top and make COMMAND the last (rightmost) column\ndisplayed.  If necessary, use the âcâ command toggle to display\ncommand lines and ensure that forest view mode is active with\nthe âVâ command toggle.\nThen use the up/down arrow keys to position the display so that\nsome truncated command lines are shown (â+â in last position).\nYou may have to resize your xterm to produce truncation.\nLastly, use the âjâ command toggle to make the COMMAND column\nright justified.\nNow use the right arrow key to reach the COMMAND column.\nContinuing with the right arrow key, watch closely the\ndirection of travel for the command lines being shown.\nsome lines travel left, while others travel right\neventually all lines will Switcheroo, and move right\n9.

The default\naction for this signal is to terminate the process. This signal\nshould be used in preference to the\nKILL\nsignal (number 9), since\na process may install a handler for the TERM signal in order to\nperform clean-up steps before terminating in an orderly fashion.\nIf a process does not terminate after a\nTERM\nsignal has been sent,\nthen the\nKILL\nsignal may be used; be aware that the latter signal\ncannot be caught, and so does not give the target process the\nopportunity to perform any clean-up before terminating.\nMost modern shells have a builtin\nkill\ncommand, with a usage\nrather similar to that of the command described here. The\n--all\n,\n--pid\n, and\n--queue\noptions, and the possibility to specify\nprocesses by command name, are local extensions.\nIf\nsignal\nis 0, then no actual signal is sent, but error checking\nis still performed.\nARGUMENTS\ntop\nThe list of processes to be signaled can be a mixture of names and\nPIDs.\npid\nEach\npid\ncan be expressed in one of the following ways:\nn\nwhere\nn\nis larger than 0. The process with PID\nn\nis\nsignaled.\n0\nAll processes in the current process group are signaled.\n-1\nAll processes with a PID larger than 1 are signaled.\n-\nn\nwhere\nn\nis larger than 1. All processes in process group\nn\nare signaled. When an argument of the form '-n' is given,\nand it is meant to denote a process group, either a signal\nmust be specified first, or the argument must be preceded\nby a '--' option, otherwise it will be taken as the signal\nto send.\nname\nAll processes invoked using this\nname\nwill be signaled.\nOPTIONS\ntop\n-s\n,\n--signal\nsignal\nThe signal to send.

The\nvalue\nargument is an integer that is sent along with the\nsignal. If the receiving process has installed a handler for\nthis signal using the\nSA_SIGINFO\nflag to\nsigaction(2)\n, then it\ncan obtain this data via the\nsi_sigval\nfield of the\nsiginfo_t\nstructure.\n--timeout\nmilliseconds signal\nSend a signal defined in the usual way to a process, followed\nby an additional signal after a specified delay. The\n--timeout\noption causes\nkill\nto wait for a period defined in\nmilliseconds\nbefore sending a follow-up\nsignal\nto the process.\nThis feature is implemented using the Linux kernel PID file\ndescriptor feature in order to guarantee that the follow-up\nsignal is sent to the same process or not sent if the process\nno longer exists.\nNote that the operating system may re-use PIDs and\nimplementing an equivalent feature in a shell using\nkill\nand\nsleep\nwould be subject to races whereby the follow-up signal\nmight be sent to a different process that used a recycled PID.\nThe\n--timeout\noption can be specified multiple times: the\nsignals are sent sequentially with the specified timeouts. The\n--timeout\noption can be combined with the\n--queue\noption.\nAs an example, the following command sends the signals\nQUIT\n,\nTERM\nand\nKILL\nin sequence and waits for 1000 milliseconds\nbetween sending the signals:\nkill --verbose --timeout 1000 TERM --timeout 1000 KILL \\\n--signal QUIT 12345\n-d\n,\n--show-process-state\npid\nDecode signal related fields in /proc/\npid\n/status.\n$ kill -d $$\nBlocked: INT\nIgnored: TERM TSTP TTIN TTOU\nCaught: HUP INT PIPE ALRM CHLD WINCH\n-h\n,\n--help\nDisplay help text and exit.\n-V\n,\n--version\nDisplay version and exit.\nEXIT STATUS\ntop\nkill\nhas the following exit status values:\n0\nsuccess\n1\nfailure\n64\npartial success (when more than one process specified)\nNOTES\ntop\nAlthough it is possible to specify the TID (thread ID, see\ngettid(2)\n) of one of the threads in a multithreaded process as the\nargument of\nkill\n, the signal is nevertheless directed to the\nprocess (i.e., the entire thread group). In other words, it is not\npossible to send a signal to an explicitly selected thread in a\nmultithreaded process. The signal will be delivered to an\narbitrarily selected thread in the target process that is not\nblocking the signal. For more details, see\nsignal(7)\nand the\ndescription of\nCLONE_THREAD\nin\nclone(2)\n.\nVarious shells provide a builtin\nkill\ncommand that is preferred in\nrelation to the\nkill(1)\nexecutable described by this manual.

Each user can define their own crontab.  Commands\ndefined in any given crontab are executed under the user who owns\nthat particular crontab.  Uucp and News usually have their own\ncrontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running\nsu(1)\nas\npart of a cron command.\nBlank lines, leading spaces, and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose\nfirst non-white space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments,\nand are not processed.  Note that comments are not allowed on the\nsame line as cron commands, since they are considered a part of\nthe command.  Similarly, comments are not allowed on the same line\nas environment variable settings.\nAn active line in a crontab is either an environment setting or a\ncron command.  An environment setting is of the form:\nname = value\nwhere the white spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and\nany subsequent non-leading white spaces in\nvalue\nis a part of the\nvalue assigned to\nname\n.  The\nvalue\nstring may be placed in quotes\n(single or double, but matching) to preserve leading or trailing\nwhite spaces.\nSeveral environment variables are set up automatically by the\ncron(8)\ndaemon.\nSHELL\nis set to /bin/sh, and\nLOGNAME\nand\nHOME\nare\nset from the /etc/passwd line of the crontabÂ´s owner.\nHOME\nand\nSHELL\ncan be overridden by settings in the crontab; LOGNAME can\nnot.\n(Note: the\nLOGNAME\nvariable is sometimes called\nUSER\non BSD\nsystems and is also automatically set).\nIn addition to\nLOGNAME\n,\nHOME\n, and\nSHELL\n,\ncron(8)\nlooks at the\nMAILTO\nvariable if a mail needs to be send as a result of running\nany commands in that particular crontab.  If\nMAILTO\nis defined\n(and non-empty), mail is sent to the specified address.  If\nMAILTO\nis defined but empty (\nMAILTO=\"\"\n), no mail is sent.  Otherwise,\nmail is sent to the owner of the crontab.  This option is useful\nif you decide to use /bin/mail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail as\nyour mailer.  Note that /bin/mail does not provide aliasing and\nUUCP usually does not read its mail.  If\nMAILFROM\nis defined (and\nnon-empty), it is used as the envelope sender address, otherwise,\nthe username of the executing user is used. This variable is also\ninherited from the crond process environment.\n(Note: Both\nMAILFROM\nand\nMAILTO\nvariables are expanded, so setting\nthem as in the following example works as expected:\nMAILFROM=cron-$USER@cron.com ($USER is replaced by the system\nuser) )\nBy default, cron sends a mail using the 'Content-Type:' header of\n'text/plain' with the 'charset=' parameter set to the\n'charmap/codeset' of the locale in which\ncrond(8)\nis started up,\ni.e., either the default system locale, if no LC_* environment\nvariables are set, or the locale specified by the LC_* environment\nvariables (see\nlocale(7)\n).  Different character encodings can be\nused for mailing cron job outputs by setting the\nCONTENT_TYPE\nand\nCONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING\nvariables in a crontab to the correct\nvalues of the mail headers of those names.\nThe\nCRON_TZ\nvariable specifies the time zone specific for the cron\ntable.  The user should enter a time according to the specified\ntime zone into the table.  The time used for writing into a log\nfile is taken from the local time zone, where the daemon is\nrunning.\nThe\nMLS_LEVEL\nenvironment variable provides support for multiple\nper-job SELinux security contexts in the same crontab.  By\ndefault, cron jobs execute with the default SELinux security\ncontext of the user that created the crontab file.  When using\nmultiple security levels and roles, this may not be sufficient,\nbecause the same user may be running in different roles or in\ndifferent security levels.  For more information about roles and\nSELinux MLS/MCS, see\nselinux(8)\nand the crontab example mentioned\nlater on in this text.  You can set the\nMLS_LEVEL\nvariable to the\nSELinux security context string specifying the particular SELinux\nsecurity context in which you want jobs to be run.\ncrond\nwill\nthen set the execution context of those jobs that meet the\nspecifications of the particular security context.  For more\ninformation, see\ncrontab(1)\n-s option.\nThe\nRANDOM_DELAY\nvariable allows delaying job startups by random\namount of minutes with upper limit specified by the variable. The\nrandom scaling factor is determined during the cron daemon startup\nso it remains constant for the whole run time of the daemon.\nThe format of a cron command is similar to the V7 standard, with a\nnumber of upward-compatible extensions.  Each line has five time-\nand-date fields followed by a\nuser\nname (if this is the\nsystem\ncrontab file), and followed by a command.  Commands are executed\nby\ncron(8)\nwhen the 'minute', 'hour', and 'month of the year'\nfields match the current time,\nand\nat least one of the two 'day'\nfields ('day of month', or 'day of week') match the current time\n(see \"Note\" below).\nNote that this means that non-existent times, such as the \"missing\nhours\" during the daylight savings time conversion, will never\nmatch, causing jobs scheduled during the \"missing times\" not to be\nrun.  Similarly, times that occur more than once (again, during\nthe daylight savings time conversion) will cause matching jobs to\nbe run twice.\ncron(8)\nexamines cron entries every minute.\nThe time and date fields are:\nfield          allowed values\n-----          --------------\nminute         0-59\nhour           0-23\nday of month   1-31\nmonth          1-12 (or names, see below)\nday of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)\nA field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for\n\"first-last\".\nRanges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated\nwith a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example,\n8-11 for an 'hours' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10,\nand 11. The first number must be less than or equal to the second\none.\nRandomization of the execution time within a range can be used.  A\nrandom number within a range specified as two numbers separated\nwith a tilde is picked.  The specified range is inclusive.  For\nexample, 6~15 for a 'minutes' entry picks a random minute within 6\nto 15 range.  The random number is picked when crontab file is\nparsed.  The first number must be less than or equal to the second\none. You might omit one or both of the numbers specifying the\nrange.  For example, ~ for a 'minutes' entry picks a random minute\nwithin 0 to 59 range.\nLists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)\nseparated by commas.  Examples: \"1,2,5,9\", \"0-4,8-12\".\nStep values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a\nrange with \"/<number>\" specifies skips of the number's value\nthrough the range.  For example, \"0-23/2\" can be used in the\n'hours' field to specify command execution for every other hour\n(the alternative in the V7 standard is \"0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,\n20,22\").  Step values are also permitted after an asterisk, so if\nspecifying a job to be run every two hours, you can use \"*/2\".\nPlease note that steps are evaluated just within the field they\nare applied to. For example \"*/23\" in hours field means to execute\nthe job on the hour 0 and the hour 23 within a calendar day. See\n\"NOTES\" below for a workaround.\nNames can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.\nUse the first three letters of the particular day or month (case\ndoes not matter).  Ranges and lists of names are allowed.\nExamples: \"mon,wed,fri\", \"jan-mar\".\nIf the UID of the owner is 0 (root), the first character of a\ncrontab entry can be \"-\" character. This will prevent cron from\nwriting a syslog message about the command being executed.\nThe \"sixth\" field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to\nbe run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline\nor a \"%\" character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell\nspecified in the SHELL variable of the cronfile.  A \"%\" character\nin the command, unless escaped with a backslash (\\), will be\nchanged into newline characters, and all data after the first %\nwill be sent to the command as standard input.\nNote: The day of a command's execution can be specified in the\nfollowing two fields â 'day of month', and 'day of week'.  If both\nfields are restricted (i.e., do not contain the \"*\" character),\nthe command will be run when\neither\nfield matches the current\ntime.  For example,\n\"30 4 1,15 * 5\" would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the\n1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.\nA crontab file syntax can be tested before an install using the -T\noption. See\ncrontab(1)\nfor details.\nEXAMPLE CRON FILE\ntop\n# use /bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says\nSHELL=/bin/sh\n# mail any output to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is\nMAILTO=paul\n#\nCRON_TZ=Japan\n# run five minutes after midnight, every day\n5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1\n# run at 2:15pm on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul\n15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly\n# run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe\n0 22 * * 1-5    mail -s \"It's 10pm\" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%\n23 0-23/2 * * * echo \"run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday\"\n5 4 * * sun     echo \"run at 5 after 4 every sunday\"\nJobs in /etc/cron.d/\ntop\nThe jobs in\ncron.d\nand\n/etc/crontab\nare system jobs, which are\nused usually for more than one user, thus, additionally the\nusername is needed.  MAILTO on the first line is optional.\nEXAMPLE OF A JOB IN /etc/cron.d/job\ntop\n#login as root\n#create job with preferred editor (e.g. vim)\nMAILTO=root\n* * * * * root touch /tmp/file\nNOTES\ntop\nAs noted above, skip values only operate within the time period\ntheyÂ´re attached to. For example, specifying \"0/35\" for the minute\nfield of a crontab entry wonÂ´t cause that entry to be executed\nevery 35 minutes; instead, it will be executed twice every hour,\nat 0 and 35 minutes past.  For more fine-grained control you can\ndo something like this:\n* * * * * if [ $(expr \\( $(date +%s) / 60 \\) % 58) = 0 ]; then echo this runs every 58 minutes; fi\n0 * * * * if [ $(expr \\( $(date +%s) / 3600 \\) % 23) = 0 ]; then echo this runs every 23 hours on the hour; fi\nAdjust as needed if your\ndate(1)\ncommand does not accept \"+%s\" as\nthe format string specifier to output the current UNIX timestamp.\nSELinux with multi level security (MLS)\ntop\nIn a crontab, it is important to specify a security level by\ncrontab -s\nor specifying the required level on the first line of\nthe crontab.  Each level is specified in\n/etc/selinux/targeted/seusers\n.  When using crontab in the MLS\nmode, it is especially important to:\n- check/change the actual role,\n- set correct\nrole for directory\n, which is used for input/output.\nEXAMPLE FOR SELINUX MLS\ntop\n# login as root\nnewrole -r sysadm_r\nmkdir /tmp/SystemHigh\nchcon -l SystemHigh /tmp/SystemHigh\ncrontab -e\n# write in crontab file\nMLS_LEVEL=SystemHigh\n0-59 * * * * id -Z > /tmp/SystemHigh/crontest\nFILES\ntop\n/etc/crontab\nmain system crontab file.\n/var/spool/cron/\na\ndirectory for storing crontabs defined by users.\n/etc/cron.d/\na\ndirectory for storing system crontabs.\nSEE ALSO\ntop\ncron(8)\n,\ncrontab(1)\nEXTENSIONS\ntop\nThese special time specification \"nicknames\" which replace the 5\ninitial time and date fields, and are prefixed with the '@'\ncharacter, are supported:\n@reboot    :    Run once after reboot.\n@yearly    :    Run once a year, ie.  \"0 0 1 1 *\".\n@annually  :    Run once a year, ie.  \"0 0 1 1 *\".\n@monthly   :    Run once a month, ie. \"0 0 1 * *\".\n@weekly    :    Run once a week, ie.  \"0 0 * * 0\".\n@daily     :    Run once a day, ie.   \"0 0 * * *\".\n@hourly    :    Run once an hour, ie. \"0 * * * *\".\nCAVEATS\ntop\ncrontab\nfiles have to be regular files or symlinks to regular\nfiles, they must not be executable or writable for anyone else but\nthe owner.  This requirement can be overridden by using the\n-p\noption on the crond command line.  If inotify support is in use,\nchanges in the symlinked crontabs are not automatically noticed by\nthe cron daemon.  The cron daemon must receive a SIGHUP signal to\nreload the crontabs.  This is a limitation of the inotify API.\ncron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline\ncharacter.  If the last entry in a crontab is missing a newline\n(i.e. terminated by EOF), cron will consider the crontab (at least\npartially) broken.  A warning will be written to syslog.\nAUTHOR\ntop\nPaul Vixie â¨vixie@isc.orgâ©\nCOLOPHON\ntop\nThis page is part of the\ncronie\n(crond daemon) project.\nInformation about the project can be found at\nâ¨\nhttps://github.com/cronie-crond/cronie\nâ©.
