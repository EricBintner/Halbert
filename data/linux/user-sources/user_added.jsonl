Follow the steps below to create your own private Tailscale network (known as a tailnet), or watch the video to learn how to get started with Tailscale and set up some useful features.\nCreate a tailnet\nGo to\ntailscale.com\nand select\nGet Started\n. Alternatively, you can\ndownload and install\nthe Tailscale client on your device, then\nsign up\n.\nOn the\nSign up with your identity provider\npage, log in using a\nsingle sign-on (SSO) identity provider\naccount.\nIf you sign up using a custom-owned domain, you are automatically enrolled in the\nEnterprise\nplan for a 14-day trial. If you sign up using a public domain email account such as\n@gmail.com\n, you are automatically enrolled in the\nPersonal\nplan, which entitles you to three free users and many of the features offered in the Enterprise plan. You can always change your plan. For details, refer to\nModify billing\n.\nOn the\nWelcome to Tailscale\npage, select either\nBusiness use\nor\nPersonal use\n.\nOn the\nLet's add your first device\npage, select the OS that corresponds to the device you are using to download and install the client. Authenticate the client using the same credentials that you used to create the tailnet in step 2.\nOnce you are authenticated, the device will appear in the browser window.\nOn the\nNext, add a second device\npage, select the OS for another machine to add to the tailnet. Copy the link and send it to the second device. After the second device is authenticated, both devices will display.\nSelect\nTake me home\n. You will be redirected to the Tailscale\nadmin console\n. This interface lets you control most aspects of your tailnet including users, devices, DNS, permissions, authentication keys, and more.\nRename devices\nEvery device added to a tailnet, including servers, nodes, phones, and personal computers is assigned a unique name generated from the device's OS hostname. This name is displayed in the\nMachines\npage of the admin console. You can also\nrename a device\nto help you locate and organize devices in the\nMachines\npage list.\nUse MagicDNS\nMagicDNS\nmakes communicating with devices across your tailnet easier by allowing you to use the name listed in the\nMachines\npage of the admin console instead of an IP address. This works using automatically assigned OS hostnames or renamed device names. MagicDNS is enabled by default, and we recommend you keep it enabled.\nInvite users\nThere are two types of tailnet user invites.\nTeam member invites are for users who will authenticate using the same identity provider you used when creating the tailnet.\nExternal invites are for users who are not part of your custom domain, such as contractors, friends, and family.\nTeam members\nIf your tailnet uses a custom domain (\nexample.com\n), users with email addresses with the same domain can log in without needing an invite. Alternatively, you can send\nteam member invites\nto notify them to join.\nExternal users\nTo invite external users to a tailnet, open the\nUsers\npage of the admin console, select\nInvite external users\n, and choose one of the following options:\nInvite via email\nto send one or more invites.\nCopy invite link\nto share the invite link with others.\nWhen users select the link, they will be directed to the Tailscale login page, where they can authenticate using a\nsupported single sign-on (SSO) identity provider\naccount. Once they are authenticated, users are added on the\nUsers\npage of the admin console.\nFor more information, refer to\nInvite any user to your tailnet\n.\nAdd devices\nYou can add more devices to your tailnet using one of the following methods:\nLogin\nto the tailnet from other devices using an existing user account.\nAdd servers to a tailnet using a\ntag\nas the identity of the server, and provision the server using an\nauthentication key\n. For more information, refer to\nSetting up a server on your Tailscale network\n.\nIncorporate your existing system policies such as mobile device management (MDM) to control device management. For more information, refer to\nIntegrate with an MDM solution\n.\nTailscale automatically assigns each device on your network a\nunique 100.x.y.z IP address\n, to establish stable connections between machines no matter where they are in the world, even when they switch networks or are\nbehind a firewall\n.\nTo learn more about adding devices, refer to\nAdd a device\n.\nSecure traffic using exit nodes\nKeep your internet activity private on an untrusted network by designating devices in your tailnet as exit nodes, then configure your tailnet devices to use those exit nodes.\nFor details on how to quickly configure and use exit nodes, refer to\nUse exit nodes\n.\nFor more in-depth information about exit nodes, refer to the main\nExit nodes\ntopic.\nRoute traffic using subnets\nYou can provide tailnet access to existing resources in your network using a subnet router. This can be useful if you need to access devices on which the Tailscale client cannot be installed, such as printers.\nFor details on how to quickly configure and use a subnet router, refer to\nConfigure a subnet router\n.\nFor more in-depth information about subnet routers, refer to the main\nSubnet routers\ntopic.\nManage permissions with access control policies\nYou can define your own custom permission for the users and devices in your tailnet, using\naccess control policies\n(such as\nACLs\nor\ngrants\n). These permissions are configured in the tailnet policy file, which is located on the\nAccess controls\npage of the admin console.\nMonitor and log traffic\nYou can monitor and log tailnet activity such as network traffic, client activity, tailnet configuration changes, and SSH session recordings.\nFor more information, refer to\nLogging, auditing, and streaming\n.\nUse cases\nNeed some inspiration? Tailscale can be used for a wide variety of users and environments. This section provides guidance for some common scenarios that you may want to use in your tailnet.\nDevelopers\nInteract with tailnet resources from Visual Studio Code using our\nVisual Studio Code extension\n.\nDeploy, scale, and manage containerized applications such as\nKubernetes\n,\nDocker\n, and\nProxmox\n.\nConnect to serverless apps\nsuch as AWS App Runner, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, and Heroku.\nConnect to cloud services\nsuch as AWS, Azure, Google Compute Engine, Hetzner, and Oracle Cloud.\nShare local services on your machine such as web applications, accessible only from your tailnet using\nTailscale Serve\nor share publicly over the internet using\nTailscale Funnel\n.\nShare prototype servers\nwith other colleagues without needing to modify firewall settings.\nIT admins\nManage the authentication and authorization of SSH connections in your tailnet using\nTailscale SSH\n.\nIntegrate Tailscale deployments on\nAWS\nand\nAzure\n.\nControl device and user access to your third-party applications without requiring any end-user configuration using\napp connectors\n.\nControl what users can access in their Tailscale client using\nsystem policies\n.\nUse\nTailscale SSH session recording\nto stream recordings of Tailscale SSH sessions from the destination node to a recorder node in your tailnet.\nAutomate aspects of your Tailscale network using the\nTailscale API\n.\nShare an existing service with your peers outside your domain with\nnode sharing\n.\nAdminister a computer remotely and lock down your\nconnections to a Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server\n.\nPersonal users\nConnect an\nApple TV\nto your tailnet for viewing your media server files, use your Apple TV as an\nexit node\nto route traffic through your home internet connection when you're away, or choose an exit node to route your Apple TV's traffic through.\nReceive files from a\nnetwork attached storage\n(NAS) server using FTP, and access media files from players such as VLC, Plex, and JellyFin.\nImplement DNS-based ad blocking for your tailnet using\nControl D\n,\nNextDNS\nor a\nPi-hole\nserver.\nShare files between your own devices, even across operating systems, with\nTaildrop\n.\nHost a private server for you and your peers to play\nMinecraft\nor chat on IRC.\nTroubleshooting and support\nVisit our\nSupport\npage to read common questions and answers, file bugs, request new features, observe Tailscale's operational status, or engage directly with our Support team.\nHere are some links that provide assistance for common inquiries:\nTroubleshooting guide\nProduction best practices\nSecurity best practices\nUsing Tailscale with your firewall\nLast updated\nOct 16, 2025\nOn this page\nCreate a tailnet\nRename devices\nUse MagicDNS\nInvite users\nTeam members\nExternal users\nAdd devices\nSecure traffic using exit nodes\nRoute traffic using subnets\nManage permissions with access control policies\nMonitor and log traffic\nUse cases\nDevelopers\nIT admins\nPersonal users\nTroubleshooting and support", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install", "source_name": "Tailscale", "trust_tier": 1, "publisher": "Tailscale", "fetch_date": "2025-11-29T10:12:06.544271", "content_hash": "839e45b4d799d1c0"}}
